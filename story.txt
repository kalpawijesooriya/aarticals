      Do you ever think about starting your own business someday? Most of us are thinking about getting a white collar job. Is it the thing you really dreamt about? Or you chose that because, it is a secure way of getting a satisfying payment and you don’t have to face a risk. Every one of us has a passion hidden in our soul. There are things we like to do with a great love. Instead of sticking to conventional 9-5, don’t you like to follow that passion and make that dream a reality? If you can turn your skills and hobbies in to money, isn’t it sound amazing? I am going to show you some good reasons why you should start your own business.

Why Entrepreneurship? 

Entrepreneurship gives you the chance to pursue your passion. Do what you love and start your business with it. Then you can enjoy your work. You can work according to your own schedule. Initially you will have to work for long hours, but after your business gets established, you get more spare time eventually. You can spend more time with your family and friends. You can set your own deadlines and can create your own environment. You can plan the business as you want.  Before starting the business, you have to study the industry, market, technology and many more related things. It makes you go through a large learning process. Automatically you become a lifelong learner. You get new experiences every day. You get new contacts. You will learn how to embrace the success and also failures. When you are getting successful you get the feeling that you are the one who did that. The pride and the self-confidence begin to develop. It’s a great feeling that one should experience in her/his life time.  
When you are an entrepreneur, you become a person who makes job opportunities for many more people. Their success becomes your satisfaction. You are the one who creates the path for someone to achieve their dreams. You can learn from the role models in the field and, also can help those who are less experienced in the field. With your establishment, your product or the service also gets branded. You get known for something valuable among the public. You get recognition. Entrepreneurship paves the way to achieve higher financial goals. Through this journey you get a variety of experiences other than the financial benefits than working in a 9-5 office. Someday you will have a great story to tell your children and even the grandchildren. Finally when you own a business, there is something you can pass to your next generation. You can be proud because you are the one who initiate it.

Acquire with Experience

There are some qualities in every successful entrepreneur practices in his/her life. If you want to be a successful entrepreneur, developing those qualities is an essential fact. If you want to wear the crown, then first you have to learn how to bear the crown.
Successful entrepreneurs always have a burning passion inside them. They do what they love and they love what they do. The effort that they exert to make the business success gives them a joy beyond money. Successful entrepreneurs are not the people who work in a restricted area. They go out and search for new things. They are forced to do so because of the burning curiosity and passion within them. They know what to do next, they focus on making their businesses work. They are disciplined enough to take steps in every single day towards the realization of their objectives. There are lots of opportunities for a business in our surrounding. An Entrepreneur should be open minded to view those opportunities, to grab them and to set their goal. Entrepreneurs should have enough confidence and the determination. They know how to turn their failures into success. They learn from the failures and they consider those failures as opportunities. Successful entrepreneurs always have good communication skills. They know how to market their product. They know how to motivate their employees, which in fact affect directly for the success of the business. They also follow good and strong ethics in their work. Entrepreneurs should have the creativity to do and to think of something innovative. Successful entrepreneurs can predict what the market need in another 20 years. An entrepreneur should have that ability to foresee in their industries and the markets. 

Look before you leap

If you are dreaming about starting your own business, then you have to start from scratch. First you have to choose what you are going to sell; whether it is a product a service. It depends on your choice. That will help you to work with a burning passion. Choose something you can get use of your unique skills. After deciding what you are going to sell, you have to study that particular industry. Study about the technology used, your competitors and what type of customers you will have. Then you get a rough idea about what you should do and how it should be done. This can be done by surfing through the internet, going out and talking to people and reading industry magazines. You should evaluate the market. How urgently people need your product or service, market size, will the product continue to relevant as the time passes and how long it will take to get into the market. This studying and evaluating part is critical. After getting a good knowledge about your industry, it becomes much easier to plan the business and execu
Mistakes and failures can get minimized by researching more about the market and the industry. Before starting the business, keep a source of cash with you. Find a good team. You will find that there are many people with great talents. Build a good connection with them and always motivate them. Get advices from the expertise in the field. If you want you can get the help of a good mentor. Build contacts with both inside and outside. After having a general idea about the surrounding start to write the business plan and draw a rough sketch of it. Then you can clearly identify your goals and the path to those goals. Most importantly solidify your legal framework. Those are few tips you can follow when starting a new business.

It’s Now or Never

Starting something new is not easy. But don’t forget! We all have a capacity than we think.  We all have a passion for something. Don’t let that passion die. Get it out of your soul and work with all your heart. Take the risk. Life comes only one time. Live it to the fullest. Don’t afraid to do mistakes. Learn from them and climb the ladder of success. 
“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.” —Steve Jobs, Apple Inc. Co-founder, Chairman and CEO

“Technology” has an interminably evolving quality, irrespective of the situation of external factors. In a technological perspective, “manufacturing” is known as the process which transforms raw material, to a final product. “Manufacturing” came into being ever since the human brain proved its potential to make things happen. With the evolution of technology, conventional manufacturing processes were rapidly and constantly replaced by advanced manufacturing technologies. The technologies used at present too, will soon be supplanted by even better technologies. The development of technologies will simplify manufacturing process than ever before.

History Timeline

In the early stages of the evolution of technology, which was set in motion through the industrial revolution, manufacturing was done by skilled workers with assistants; the entire process was carried out manually, manufacturing took place mostly in rural households to craft products like furniture, decorative arts, sculptures, clothing, jewelry, food items, household items and tools or even mechanisms like the handmade clockwork movement of a watchmaker. With the onset of the industrial revolution, the humble and unpretentious beginnings of manufacturing was subjected to many abrupt changes, amendments and improvements. 

Machines came to play a major role in manufacturing processes, leading to process automation in the long-run, substituting human undertakings with control systems. The subsequent advancement in the concept of automation, being the introduction of Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Machines which carry out conventional lathe, milling and grinding process by programmed machines, without human intervention after the point of providing the computer code, is preceded the entrance of robotic technology to the manufacturing sector, providing much flexibility for machines than that offered by CNC. 
Modern-day manufacturing is far beyond just automation, CNC and robotics; it is a combination of highly advanced mechanics, electronics and computer systems which give prominence to material improvement. Modern-day manufacturing consists of managerial aspects in addition to the aforesaid technological facets. Focus of this article is on giving you a glimpse of the “advanced” technologies that use “advanced” raw materials to produce final products.

Automated tape laying

A trend of modern manufacturing processes is to use composites as raw materials. Automated Tape Laying (ATL) is a new manufacturing technology which produces complex parts from rapid deposition of composite, pre-impregnated tapes with either a flat or curved tool. In aircraft construction, tape laying has become a major technology. In the tape laying process, 70 mm to 200 mm wide carbon fiber tapes and composite resins are placed layer-by-layer on a flat support and cut off parallel, at the edges of the work piece. When the edges are complexed, pre-cut tape segments are used, where the tape has to be positioned precisely. This technology has replaced the conventional time-consuming manufacturing process of manual lay-up for large carbon-fiber components which are flat or in simple curves. If an ATL machine is considered, it lays down a wide, single carbon-fiber prepreg tape, where the machine head is used to press the tape against the tool to strengthen the layers of material.


Automated fiber placement

Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) is another manufacturing process which deals with carbon fiber-based composite materials and is similar to the ATL process. Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) can be identified as one of the most tech-employing methods for fabricating composite structures. This method is used almost exclusively with continuous fiber reinforced tape, where a robot is used to place composite material and build a structure, one layer at a time. The Processes, altogether, have the ability to produce highly customized parts; since each layer can even be placed at different angles. The use of robotics provides the operator active control over all the critical variables of the process, making the process highly controllable and repeatable.


Resin infusion

Resin infusion is a trending and sophisticated technique for producing high performance, zero void composites even on large and/or complicated molds. This process is largely suitable to the manufacture of carbon fiber composites and is widely used by professional manufacturers in the production of components of carbon fiber. In the process of resin infusion, the voids are placed in an evacuated stack of porous material, and are filled with a liquid resin.  When the resin gets solidified, the solid resin binds the assembly of materials into a unified rigid composite.  The reinforcement can be any porous material compatible with the resin.  Typical materials are inorganic fibers (with glass fiber being most common), organic fibers such as flax, or combinations of fibers with other materials such as closed cell foams, balsawood, and honeycomb.  Porous materials can also be infused onto the surfaces of non-porous materials 

Laser ablation

This manufacturing process works by removing the resin from the composite. TEA CO2 laser with a low energy density is used to vaporize the resin. There is no contact during the process in contrast to traditional machining and grinding where fibers may suffer local damage. The exposed fibers are brushed away until the repair is ready for replacement material to be bonded in place. This is a semi-automation of the preparation process, for repairs to of composite parts, where in field capability is present. This manufacturing process has a reduced time and cost with efficient repair and can be used in all composite structures.

Plasma deposition

Plasma deposition is a modern manufacturing process mostly used in aerospace manufacturing where thermal spray techniques allow coating materials to be rapidly deposited onto structures. Coating materials are wire fed and heat is applied up to melting or near melting point and are then accelerated towards the substrate structure. Layers of material are built with multiple passes to achieve the required coating thickness. Controlled coating thickness can be achieved through this process. The Specialty of this process is, the fact that it is highly used in manufacturing titanium parts where conventional manufacturing processes cannot be used.  Material deposition is another advantage of this process. This process is used in aerospace engine blade fabrication and engine blade repairs.

Rapid prototyping 
The word rapid prototyping may not be familiar to 3D printing, but 3D printing is a rapid prototyping method after all. Rapid prototyping is a generic term for a number of manufacturing methods. It is an additive manufacturing method where raw materials are added layer by layer, to make the final product. Depending on the material form, rapid prototyping is divided as liquid based, solid based and power based. This manufacturing process is also called layer manufacturing.

Apart from the methods cited above, there are plenty of other highly advanced manufacturing technologies. All these manufacturing methods have come into being with the fusion of the “advancement of technology” with the “advancement of material”. These so called “advanced” technologies will indubitably get replaced in recent future with more advanced ones. This continuous improvement of technology and material would undeniably propel the human race forward, taking them to a whole new level and era of manufacturing and productivity.

What is AI?
      
According to Wikipedia, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is, intelligence exhibited by machines. AI has become a common concept since the early 21st century. Ava in Ex-Machina (2015), Jarvis in Iron Man (2008) and Agent Smith in Matrix (1999) strongly reveal the expectations of mankind regarding AI; the overall research goal of which, is to make machines and computers think. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems.

What are ‘Bots’?

In early 2016, we saw the introduction of the first wave of artificial intelligence technology in the form of ‘Chatbots’.  ‘Internet bots’ or ‘Chatbots’ or simply, ‘Bots’ are software applications which perform automated tasks like ordering pizza, setting alarm, booking flight tickets etc. 
The concept of computers communicating like humans was contemplated in the 1950s and ’60s with contributions from computer scientists like Alan Turing, who developed the Turing Test to test a computer’s ability to display intelligent behavior equivalent to or indistinguishable from that of a human. In 1996 Joseph Weizenbaum invented Eliza, the first bot which could be introduced as a psychotherapist who talks / chats with the client and diagnoses psychological matters based on the client’s answers and takes it even further, by asking more questions based on previous answers.
The bots we talk about nowadays are, most likely, virtual personal assistants. ‘Siri’ and ‘Cortana’ are the common world examples for modern bots, who can perform some predefined tasks repetitively, to make your day -to-day life easier. As technology grows at a faster rate than that at which time passes, we would be able to find chat bots in many messaging apps including Facebook, Whatsapp, Kik, Skype and Telegram, with the improvement of artificial intelligent technologies. 



What do bots do?

Though bots are not smart as Jarvis in iron man yet, apps are being replaced by bots, revolutionarily. The most common use of bots, as at present, is in web spidering. The bots used for this are called web crawlers; they systematically browse the internet and update web sites’ contents or indices of web content. They could not only maintain a repository of websites, but also copy or browse websites at a speed that is 100 times faster than that at which a human being could do the same. Searching and storing starts with the set of URLs supplied by the user and could be downloaded in a limited number of websites, in a given time. Servers that host websites show different counteractions towards bots; Servers may choose to outline rules on the behaviour of internet bots by implementing a robots.txt file which contains simple texts that state the rules governing a bot's behaviour on that specific server. 
Though some web crawler bots like ‘Search Engine Bots’ have ethical manners, there are malicious bots that could perform harsh attacks. Certain bots could be handled by various customer service requests; Taco Bell, an American fast-food chain has introduced a chat bot through which customers could order tacos and pay through textual conversations. A ‘Knowbot’ could automatically collect information from websites, on behalf of the user, to meet certain user requirements. A ‘Shopbot’ program scans ‘visited’ online shopping sites and seeks products that fit the price the user searches for. 
“Chatbots” used in messaging apps, supply internet based services via Instant Messaging (IM) and Internet Relay Chat (IRC) while allowing users to ask questions using simple plain language formats, and answering back simply. CNN, Shop Spring, Health Tap in Facebook and Sensay, TheScore, Vine in kik and the Amazon Bot, National Geographic Bot in telegram are newly developed chatbots of messaging apps. Chatbots like OpenSesame observe user patterns in navigating a web sites and customizes the site for the user. Bots like ‘X.ai’ could help in scheduling and managing user’s meetings by adding bots into email trends, allowing to browse chat conversations and emails.

Creating your own Facebook chatbot

Although it has been only a short time since chatbot applications came into the industry, there are plenty of bot platforms on which you could develop your own chatbots, to meet your requirements. Making your own chatbot is proven to be very useful for people who own service based businesses. Chatbots are services that mimic conversations with people, to interact with customers, helping monetize social media accounts and instant messaging profiles. Simply put, you give common language understanding to your Facebook Messenger application by converting it to an artificial intelligence bot. Chatbots are increasingly becoming an essential part of digital marketing strategies. Tools like Chatfuel, Botsify, and OnSequel will let you create a chatbot without letting you do complicated programming. The only requirement, in fact, is to have a Facebook account and/or your own Facebook page, which could be easily and freely fulfilled. Chatbots answer questions asked by the customer using keywords the developer has supplied before. 
 

LUIS.ai

While most bot builder platforms allow users to implement chatbots that could be used inside another messenger application, ‘LUIS’ – Language Understanding Intelligent Service, which is a part of Microsoft’s Cognitive Services Suite, allows you to build your own bot applications. After using hundreds of different applications to fulfil daily activities, people would be fed up with user interfaces, commanding buttons and of having to follow several steps to accomplish very simple activities like ordering a pizza, booking a ticket etc. LUIS allows you to integrate your understanding of natural languages to your application and make you feel as if you are chatting with someone rather than commanding through an application or interface. For example, you could simply type “I would like to book a holiday to Paris” and then, all the processes would happen, eliminating the need of having to search the web or log into different apps.
LUIS enables developers to build smart apps which could receive commands through natural languages and react accordingly. Illustrating on “Cutting Edge Machine Learning” from Microsoft Research, there are many out of the box, pre-built LUIS apps and models from Bing and Cortana, which could be used if needs are met. In addition to this, there is an option to develop your own LUIS app with specialized requirements around your own domain. The output of the LUIS app is a web service with an http endpoint. It is required to follow a step by step process in your LUIS.ai account, through which you would state your intents for the app (ex: booking tickets), the entities or key data related to your intents (ex: travel class) and utterances or sentences that the user may input to the system, (ex: please book me a ticket in economy class) to enhance the language learning experience of your app.  After testing and publishing, you would get a link of the code for further implementation. 
 
Does the future belong to Bot?

A new era of conversational interfaces has begun with the introduction of chatbots to the society. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the future belongs to bots. The app boom is over. There are more than 4.2 million applications available for ios and android. “Within a few years, bot will be the fabric of everything”, says Phil Libin, The Managing Director at General Catalyst. 
Bots are becoming more common in messaging apps with which we spend a pretty long time nowadays. It is not surprising to find Microsoft introducing ‘Murphybot’ to Skype and Apple is trying to develop siri much further by giving it lots of day to day functionalities and voice recognition abilities, behind the scene. 
Yes, bots could be the future. Bots could bring to you, a future that defies googling, launching apps, searching and clicking and swiping; a future which does not need screens or pointing devices to navigate. Bots will do it all. We could look forward to see chatbot making its entrance to many more business models through which we could order pizza without having any time wasted over telephone conversations. Yes, bots will make living more comfortable. The day in which you would install your own “Jarvis” is not far away.
