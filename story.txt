      Do you ever think about starting your own business someday? Most of us are thinking about getting a white collar job. Is it the thing you really dreamt about? Or you chose that because, it is a secure way of getting a satisfying payment and you don’t have to face a risk. Every one of us has a passion hidden in our soul. There are things we like to do with a great love. Instead of sticking to conventional 9-5, don’t you like to follow that passion and make that dream a reality? If you can turn your skills and hobbies in to money, isn’t it sound amazing? I am going to show you some good reasons why you should start your own business.

Why Entrepreneurship? 

Entrepreneurship gives you the chance to pursue your passion. Do what you love and start your business with it. Then you can enjoy your work. You can work according to your own schedule. Initially you will have to work for long hours, but after your business gets established, you get more spare time eventually. You can spend more time with your family and friends. You can set your own deadlines and can create your own environment. You can plan the business as you want.  Before starting the business, you have to study the industry, market, technology and many more related things. It makes you go through a large learning process. Automatically you become a lifelong learner. You get new experiences every day. You get new contacts. You will learn how to embrace the success and also failures. When you are getting successful you get the feeling that you are the one who did that. The pride and the self-confidence begin to develop. It’s a great feeling that one should experience in her/his life time.  
When you are an entrepreneur, you become a person who makes job opportunities for many more people. Their success becomes your satisfaction. You are the one who creates the path for someone to achieve their dreams. You can learn from the role models in the field and, also can help those who are less experienced in the field. With your establishment, your product or the service also gets branded. You get known for something valuable among the public. You get recognition. Entrepreneurship paves the way to achieve higher financial goals. Through this journey you get a variety of experiences other than the financial benefits than working in a 9-5 office. Someday you will have a great story to tell your children and even the grandchildren. Finally when you own a business, there is something you can pass to your next generation. You can be proud because you are the one who initiate it.

Acquire with Experience

There are some qualities in every successful entrepreneur practices in his/her life. If you want to be a successful entrepreneur, developing those qualities is an essential fact. If you want to wear the crown, then first you have to learn how to bear the crown.
Successful entrepreneurs always have a burning passion inside them. They do what they love and they love what they do. The effort that they exert to make the business success gives them a joy beyond money. Successful entrepreneurs are not the people who work in a restricted area. They go out and search for new things. They are forced to do so because of the burning curiosity and passion within them. They know what to do next, they focus on making their businesses work. They are disciplined enough to take steps in every single day towards the realization of their objectives. There are lots of opportunities for a business in our surrounding. An Entrepreneur should be open minded to view those opportunities, to grab them and to set their goal. Entrepreneurs should have enough confidence and the determination. They know how to turn their failures into success. They learn from the failures and they consider those failures as opportunities. Successful entrepreneurs always have good communication skills. They know how to market their product. They know how to motivate their employees, which in fact affect directly for the success of the business. They also follow good and strong ethics in their work. Entrepreneurs should have the creativity to do and to think of something innovative. Successful entrepreneurs can predict what the market need in another 20 years. An entrepreneur should have that ability to foresee in their industries and the markets. 

Look before you leap

If you are dreaming about starting your own business, then you have to start from scratch. First you have to choose what you are going to sell; whether it is a product a service. It depends on your choice. That will help you to work with a burning passion. Choose something you can get use of your unique skills. After deciding what you are going to sell, you have to study that particular industry. Study about the technology used, your competitors and what type of customers you will have. Then you get a rough idea about what you should do and how it should be done. This can be done by surfing through the internet, going out and talking to people and reading industry magazines. You should evaluate the market. How urgently people need your product or service, market size, will the product continue to relevant as the time passes and how long it will take to get into the market. This studying and evaluating part is critical. After getting a good knowledge about your industry, it becomes much easier to plan the business and execu
Mistakes and failures can get minimized by researching more about the market and the industry. Before starting the business, keep a source of cash with you. Find a good team. You will find that there are many people with great talents. Build a good connection with them and always motivate them. Get advices from the expertise in the field. If you want you can get the help of a good mentor. Build contacts with both inside and outside. After having a general idea about the surrounding start to write the business plan and draw a rough sketch of it. Then you can clearly identify your goals and the path to those goals. Most importantly solidify your legal framework. Those are few tips you can follow when starting a new business.

It’s Now or Never

Starting something new is not easy. But don’t forget! We all have a capacity than we think.  We all have a passion for something. Don’t let that passion die. Get it out of your soul and work with all your heart. Take the risk. Life comes only one time. Live it to the fullest. Don’t afraid to do mistakes. Learn from them and climb the ladder of success. 
“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.” —Steve Jobs, Apple Inc. Co-founder, Chairman and CEO

“Technology” has an interminably evolving quality, irrespective of the situation of external factors. In a technological perspective, “manufacturing” is known as the process which transforms raw material, to a final product. “Manufacturing” came into being ever since the human brain proved its potential to make things happen. With the evolution of technology, conventional manufacturing processes were rapidly and constantly replaced by advanced manufacturing technologies. The technologies used at present too, will soon be supplanted by even better technologies. The development of technologies will simplify manufacturing process than ever before.

History Timeline

In the early stages of the evolution of technology, which was set in motion through the industrial revolution, manufacturing was done by skilled workers with assistants; the entire process was carried out manually, manufacturing took place mostly in rural households to craft products like furniture, decorative arts, sculptures, clothing, jewelry, food items, household items and tools or even mechanisms like the handmade clockwork movement of a watchmaker. With the onset of the industrial revolution, the humble and unpretentious beginnings of manufacturing was subjected to many abrupt changes, amendments and improvements. 

Machines came to play a major role in manufacturing processes, leading to process automation in the long-run, substituting human undertakings with control systems. The subsequent advancement in the concept of automation, being the introduction of Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Machines which carry out conventional lathe, milling and grinding process by programmed machines, without human intervention after the point of providing the computer code, is preceded the entrance of robotic technology to the manufacturing sector, providing much flexibility for machines than that offered by CNC. 
Modern-day manufacturing is far beyond just automation, CNC and robotics; it is a combination of highly advanced mechanics, electronics and computer systems which give prominence to material improvement. Modern-day manufacturing consists of managerial aspects in addition to the aforesaid technological facets. Focus of this article is on giving you a glimpse of the “advanced” technologies that use “advanced” raw materials to produce final products.

Automated tape laying

A trend of modern manufacturing processes is to use composites as raw materials. Automated Tape Laying (ATL) is a new manufacturing technology which produces complex parts from rapid deposition of composite, pre-impregnated tapes with either a flat or curved tool. In aircraft construction, tape laying has become a major technology. In the tape laying process, 70 mm to 200 mm wide carbon fiber tapes and composite resins are placed layer-by-layer on a flat support and cut off parallel, at the edges of the work piece. When the edges are complexed, pre-cut tape segments are used, where the tape has to be positioned precisely. This technology has replaced the conventional time-consuming manufacturing process of manual lay-up for large carbon-fiber components which are flat or in simple curves. If an ATL machine is considered, it lays down a wide, single carbon-fiber prepreg tape, where the machine head is used to press the tape against the tool to strengthen the layers of material.


Automated fiber placement

Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) is another manufacturing process which deals with carbon fiber-based composite materials and is similar to the ATL process. Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) can be identified as one of the most tech-employing methods for fabricating composite structures. This method is used almost exclusively with continuous fiber reinforced tape, where a robot is used to place composite material and build a structure, one layer at a time. The Processes, altogether, have the ability to produce highly customized parts; since each layer can even be placed at different angles. The use of robotics provides the operator active control over all the critical variables of the process, making the process highly controllable and repeatable.


Resin infusion

Resin infusion is a trending and sophisticated technique for producing high performance, zero void composites even on large and/or complicated molds. This process is largely suitable to the manufacture of carbon fiber composites and is widely used by professional manufacturers in the production of components of carbon fiber. In the process of resin infusion, the voids are placed in an evacuated stack of porous material, and are filled with a liquid resin.  When the resin gets solidified, the solid resin binds the assembly of materials into a unified rigid composite.  The reinforcement can be any porous material compatible with the resin.  Typical materials are inorganic fibers (with glass fiber being most common), organic fibers such as flax, or combinations of fibers with other materials such as closed cell foams, balsawood, and honeycomb.  Porous materials can also be infused onto the surfaces of non-porous materials 

Laser ablation

This manufacturing process works by removing the resin from the composite. TEA CO2 laser with a low energy density is used to vaporize the resin. There is no contact during the process in contrast to traditional machining and grinding where fibers may suffer local damage. The exposed fibers are brushed away until the repair is ready for replacement material to be bonded in place. This is a semi-automation of the preparation process, for repairs to of composite parts, where in field capability is present. This manufacturing process has a reduced time and cost with efficient repair and can be used in all composite structures.

Plasma deposition

Plasma deposition is a modern manufacturing process mostly used in aerospace manufacturing where thermal spray techniques allow coating materials to be rapidly deposited onto structures. Coating materials are wire fed and heat is applied up to melting or near melting point and are then accelerated towards the substrate structure. Layers of material are built with multiple passes to achieve the required coating thickness. Controlled coating thickness can be achieved through this process. The Specialty of this process is, the fact that it is highly used in manufacturing titanium parts where conventional manufacturing processes cannot be used.  Material deposition is another advantage of this process. This process is used in aerospace engine blade fabrication and engine blade repairs.

Rapid prototyping 
The word rapid prototyping may not be familiar to 3D printing, but 3D printing is a rapid prototyping method after all. Rapid prototyping is a generic term for a number of manufacturing methods. It is an additive manufacturing method where raw materials are added layer by layer, to make the final product. Depending on the material form, rapid prototyping is divided as liquid based, solid based and power based. This manufacturing process is also called layer manufacturing.

Apart from the methods cited above, there are plenty of other highly advanced manufacturing technologies. All these manufacturing methods have come into being with the fusion of the “advancement of technology” with the “advancement of material”. These so called “advanced” technologies will indubitably get replaced in recent future with more advanced ones. This continuous improvement of technology and material would undeniably propel the human race forward, taking them to a whole new level and era of manufacturing and productivity.

What is AI?
      
According to Wikipedia, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is, intelligence exhibited by machines. AI has become a common concept since the early 21st century. Ava in Ex-Machina (2015), Jarvis in Iron Man (2008) and Agent Smith in Matrix (1999) strongly reveal the expectations of mankind regarding AI; the overall research goal of which, is to make machines and computers think. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems.

What are ‘Bots’?

In early 2016, we saw the introduction of the first wave of artificial intelligence technology in the form of ‘Chatbots’.  ‘Internet bots’ or ‘Chatbots’ or simply, ‘Bots’ are software applications which perform automated tasks like ordering pizza, setting alarm, booking flight tickets etc. 
The concept of computers communicating like humans was contemplated in the 1950s and ’60s with contributions from computer scientists like Alan Turing, who developed the Turing Test to test a computer’s ability to display intelligent behavior equivalent to or indistinguishable from that of a human. In 1996 Joseph Weizenbaum invented Eliza, the first bot which could be introduced as a psychotherapist who talks / chats with the client and diagnoses psychological matters based on the client’s answers and takes it even further, by asking more questions based on previous answers.
The bots we talk about nowadays are, most likely, virtual personal assistants. ‘Siri’ and ‘Cortana’ are the common world examples for modern bots, who can perform some predefined tasks repetitively, to make your day -to-day life easier. As technology grows at a faster rate than that at which time passes, we would be able to find chat bots in many messaging apps including Facebook, Whatsapp, Kik, Skype and Telegram, with the improvement of artificial intelligent technologies. 



What do bots do?

Though bots are not smart as Jarvis in iron man yet, apps are being replaced by bots, revolutionarily. The most common use of bots, as at present, is in web spidering. The bots used for this are called web crawlers; they systematically browse the internet and update web sites’ contents or indices of web content. They could not only maintain a repository of websites, but also copy or browse websites at a speed that is 100 times faster than that at which a human being could do the same. Searching and storing starts with the set of URLs supplied by the user and could be downloaded in a limited number of websites, in a given time. Servers that host websites show different counteractions towards bots; Servers may choose to outline rules on the behaviour of internet bots by implementing a robots.txt file which contains simple texts that state the rules governing a bot's behaviour on that specific server. 
Though some web crawler bots like ‘Search Engine Bots’ have ethical manners, there are malicious bots that could perform harsh attacks. Certain bots could be handled by various customer service requests; Taco Bell, an American fast-food chain has introduced a chat bot through which customers could order tacos and pay through textual conversations. A ‘Knowbot’ could automatically collect information from websites, on behalf of the user, to meet certain user requirements. A ‘Shopbot’ program scans ‘visited’ online shopping sites and seeks products that fit the price the user searches for. 
“Chatbots” used in messaging apps, supply internet based services via Instant Messaging (IM) and Internet Relay Chat (IRC) while allowing users to ask questions using simple plain language formats, and answering back simply. CNN, Shop Spring, Health Tap in Facebook and Sensay, TheScore, Vine in kik and the Amazon Bot, National Geographic Bot in telegram are newly developed chatbots of messaging apps. Chatbots like OpenSesame observe user patterns in navigating a web sites and customizes the site for the user. Bots like ‘X.ai’ could help in scheduling and managing user’s meetings by adding bots into email trends, allowing to browse chat conversations and emails.

Creating your own Facebook chatbot

Although it has been only a short time since chatbot applications came into the industry, there are plenty of bot platforms on which you could develop your own chatbots, to meet your requirements. Making your own chatbot is proven to be very useful for people who own service based businesses. Chatbots are services that mimic conversations with people, to interact with customers, helping monetize social media accounts and instant messaging profiles. Simply put, you give common language understanding to your Facebook Messenger application by converting it to an artificial intelligence bot. Chatbots are increasingly becoming an essential part of digital marketing strategies. Tools like Chatfuel, Botsify, and OnSequel will let you create a chatbot without letting you do complicated programming. The only requirement, in fact, is to have a Facebook account and/or your own Facebook page, which could be easily and freely fulfilled. Chatbots answer questions asked by the customer using keywords the developer has supplied before. 
 

LUIS.ai

While most bot builder platforms allow users to implement chatbots that could be used inside another messenger application, ‘LUIS’ – Language Understanding Intelligent Service, which is a part of Microsoft’s Cognitive Services Suite, allows you to build your own bot applications. After using hundreds of different applications to fulfil daily activities, people would be fed up with user interfaces, commanding buttons and of having to follow several steps to accomplish very simple activities like ordering a pizza, booking a ticket etc. LUIS allows you to integrate your understanding of natural languages to your application and make you feel as if you are chatting with someone rather than commanding through an application or interface. For example, you could simply type “I would like to book a holiday to Paris” and then, all the processes would happen, eliminating the need of having to search the web or log into different apps.
LUIS enables developers to build smart apps which could receive commands through natural languages and react accordingly. Illustrating on “Cutting Edge Machine Learning” from Microsoft Research, there are many out of the box, pre-built LUIS apps and models from Bing and Cortana, which could be used if needs are met. In addition to this, there is an option to develop your own LUIS app with specialized requirements around your own domain. The output of the LUIS app is a web service with an http endpoint. It is required to follow a step by step process in your LUIS.ai account, through which you would state your intents for the app (ex: booking tickets), the entities or key data related to your intents (ex: travel class) and utterances or sentences that the user may input to the system, (ex: please book me a ticket in economy class) to enhance the language learning experience of your app.  After testing and publishing, you would get a link of the code for further implementation. 
 
Does the future belong to Bot?

A new era of conversational interfaces has begun with the introduction of chatbots to the society. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the future belongs to bots. The app boom is over. There are more than 4.2 million applications available for ios and android. “Within a few years, bot will be the fabric of everything”, says Phil Libin, The Managing Director at General Catalyst. 
Bots are becoming more common in messaging apps with which we spend a pretty long time nowadays. It is not surprising to find Microsoft introducing ‘Murphybot’ to Skype and Apple is trying to develop siri much further by giving it lots of day to day functionalities and voice recognition abilities, behind the scene. 
Yes, bots could be the future. Bots could bring to you, a future that defies googling, launching apps, searching and clicking and swiping; a future which does not need screens or pointing devices to navigate. Bots will do it all. We could look forward to see chatbot making its entrance to many more business models through which we could order pizza without having any time wasted over telephone conversations. Yes, bots will make living more comfortable. The day in which you would install your own “Jarvis” is not far away.

Supply Chain Management (SCM) & Cost Management (CM) are two leading topics on the daily agenda of business practitioners and academic researchers. 

The main issues in Supply Chain Management are; the management of material and information flows added to the management of relationships. A successful supply chain results only from the successful collaboration of the above mentioned aspects. Despite being rapidly developing; Supply Chain Management is not limited to a certain theory or practice. Hence, only a few approaches exist regarding how cost management in supply chain could be carried out successfully and efficiently.
 
Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA), Just-In-Time (JIT), Material Requirement Planning (MRP), Performance Information Procurement System (PIPS) are a few tools that could be utilized to manage cost in supply chains. Approaches such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) assist to reduce costs by changing to a customer centric approach where Activity-Based Costing assists in reducing costs and improving service levels. Virtual Enterprises help non-hierarchical production networks join forces between SMEs for improved order fulfillment and costing. Internet Technology in Purchasing helps to reduce purchasing costs for retailers. Integrating Transaction Costs would be able to introduce an analytical level to cost management systems. Cost management tools such as Target Costing, JIT and TQM, Life-Cycle Costing and continuous improvement assisted in cost planning, inventory reduction, cycle time reduction, improved customer satisfaction leading to lower returns and warranty costs, proactive management of quality-related costs extend cost analysis across the supply chains.

Cross –Docking is s a practice in logistics where materials are unloaded from an incoming semi-trailer truck and loaded directly into outbound trucks or trailers, with little or no storage in between. Walmart transmits Point of Sale (POS) information to suppliers to keep them informed about sales activities and trends. Suppliers are instructed to pack orders, therefore enabling products to be readily cross docked at Walmart’s Distribution Centers. There are limitations on Cross Docking strategy as well. This is inappropriate for bulky, slow moving products and products that have low value or long lead times. Cross Docking expedite customer orders, reduce reliance on inventory buffers and promote a flow-through supply-chain pipeline. 

China occupies a prominent place in SCM field. Statistical data in 2017 show Bestway (Hong Kong) International, BOE Technology Group Co. Ltd, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd, Jiangxi Black Cat Carbon Black Co Ltd, Lenovo Group, Rong Hua (Qing Yuan) Offset Printing as the top rated Chinese suppliers. It is elaborated that they have achieved this position with the help of new Supply Chain Management Software Systems (SCMS) such as Fishbowl, Qstrat, Uroute, Snap Fulfil, Ramp Systems, Procurify, eBid Systems, Made4net, Jda, 3PL Central and many more. 

SCMS often include forecasting, thus they balance the disparity between supply and demand by enhancing business processes. Algorithms and consumption analysis are also being used to efficiently plan future needs. SCMS also include integration technology that allow organizations to trade with supply chain parties electronically. Certain programs concentrate on business intelligence while other programs focus on inventory control or transportation management. Due to the increased efficiency and reduced labour costs caused by SCMS, cost burden of organizations could be reduced. In addition, many of the intelligence features are specifically designed to identify cost waste and its elimination thereof. 

Trend analysis and business intelligence features help control costs and improve profitability in the industrial sector by identifying products that perform steadily and guiding the users to meet market demand. While Supply chain solutions do come with a price, usually, a proper implementation will lead to a calculable return on investment (Profit) over the period. Since customers always value a fast service, speed is a very important factor to be considered for the success of any business. Apple is the company which owns the most agile supply chain. One of the main concepts that Steve Jobs followed was “Customer comes first, cost cutting comes second; Cutting costs will be in vain, if the customer is not satisfied.” As the company Amazon which owns one of the largest supply chain says, “Put yourself in customers’ shoes”. The main thing that has to be done before making changes in supply chains is to analyze and see customers’ reactions.
SCM systems aid shipping to be quick and accurate, by informing whether it’s a small parcel or larger bulk order. Speed and accuracy are key factors in organizational success and they help to keep shipping options in line with the demands of the marketplace, readjusting supply chains to meet customer preferences. 
By space utilization and maintaining an efficient storage strategy, we can reduce the cost that incur in supply process and time taken to find and pull items whenever needed. In addition, it will cut the costs of paying the personnel appointed to search for stored items. You may find if you pay too much for space and if you’re using the storage space effectively, by conducting an analysis.
It is required by companies to manage their inventories in a way that minimizes holding costs while providing enough flexibility to meet customer demands. Supply Chain Management Systems have inventory buffer levels and pre-order quantity levels which are obtained after careful analysis of historical trends. So, it is vital to have at least one person to manage the supply chain, even though the business is relatively small. Even if this person simply tracks the work of your managers and keeps them in communication with each other, you will be able to spot potential problems before they arise and prevent bottlenecks. Setting performance benchmarks for each component of your supply chain will also help you spot the potential hiccups early enough to address them. 
Depending on one supplier could leave you with costly delays in receiving products. However, it will protect you from spending money for less satisfactory service and will be a reason for the elimination for your orders. So, always find several suppliers who can compete on price and if one supplier is out, another may have the items that you require. 
As a result of ordering items earlier, they will be more likely to get lost or damaged and also, additional warehouse costs might incur. Thus, the items can be ordered according to the period you need them. The time taken to transport the supplies from where you receive them to where you use/store them, needs to be reduced. Additionally, there are certain things that have to be examined such as fluctuation of customer demand to check whether current ordering system matches the demand patterns. Supplies have to be ordered based on the most recent evaluation. Since evaluating the fluctuation of customer demand is costly, ordering has to be done with what is really essential on hand. However, having a safety stock might help when assumptions go wrong or when there are sudden changes in demand.
If the company does not practice a proper approval process, unnecessary things might be ordered unintentionally. This can also happen when an individual takes the decisions alone. Furthermore, over-ordering might happen if the business is using multiple people filling out requisition, multiple software and paper checklist.                                                                                                                                                                                       
The profit could easily be increased without increasing sales, by reducing supply costs. Breaking the supply chain to its essential elements and narrowing the focus on every phase of the supply chain helps in better management. If your materials arrive on time, your production labour and schedules would be effectively coordinated, your website shopping cart would function smoothly, your inventory process would let you efficiently store and retrieve items and the shipping process would be much more efficient, leading to zero bottlenecks. It means that there will be no idle or extra labour, lost sales or unsatisfied customers. 

Conclusion

Supply Chain Management System is a systematic approach which benefits all the aspects of an organization. A good Supply Chain Management System is more likely to reduce costs and provide a better customer service. Understanding the supply chain provides insights into supplier challenges and capabilities, which can reveal opportunities for value creation and growth by unlocking innovation.

	Think about a situation that you are in a retail shop, and you want to buy a packet of milk powder. On the shelf, there are two milk powder brands called “A” and “B” which have the same product attributes as they have advertised. Which brand would you choose? Suppose you bought “B”. Why you preferred “B” over “A”. That is where marketing comes into play. May be the packaging has your favorite colors, otherwise, you may love the song that they played in their commercial or your favorite actress may appear in the commercial. Some little facts influence our decision making more than we think. However, “B” has invaded your mind with marketing. 

What is Mind?

	Mind is a wonderful masterpiece of nature. Our behavior, beliefs, decisions, personality and simply everything about our character depends upon how clever we are in controlling our mind. Human mind consists with three conceptual layers. These layers are Conscious mind, Subconscious mind and Unconscious mind. If we consider mind as a computer, Conscious mind is an Input output device. Conscious mind associates with day-to-day activities and it represents our awareness at the present moment. Subconscious mind acts like the RAM of the computer. Subconscious mind is in charge of our recent memories, and is in continuous contact with the resources of the unconscious mind. It is the intermediate between Conscious mind and Unconscious mind. Unconscious mind is like the hard disk of the computer. we take critical decisions based on what stacked in our Unconscious mind. Unconscious mind enriches through the perceptions, cognitions and knowledge we got since the birth. It is the long-term memory we have. From here onward, let’s refer to both subconscious mind and conscious mind as subconscious in order to ease of clarification.  

What is in your mind?

	95% of brain activities are taking place in the subconscious mind. So, the good marketers try to talk with your subconscious and try to keep their message in there. when you are making a decision on buying something, your conscious mind will call the subconscious and recall the senses you had with a particular brand. Think about a commercial that looks silly, but still makes a pleasant feeling in the mind. Ever wondered what they have to do with their brand or product and what is the relationship the advertisement has with the product? while we are bothering about that, the brand has already intruded in to our mind. Keeping something to think is always a good way to sneak in to the subconscious. The commercial made us to think about the brand and somehow, we are obsessed with the brand.
	  Typical human unknowingly gets attracted to aestheticism such like; Music, Art, Humor and so forth that they stimulate the emotions. If marketer can convey the message with emotions, the chance of remembering the message is high. For example, recall an advertisement we heard in the 90’s. Still some of them we remember not because of the brand or the product, but only because of the song or music that the commercial had. Still we hum that song because we loved it. The advertisement has sneaked the brand in to our mind camouflaged with a song. 

Marketers are hypnotist

	“Nobody reads ads. People read what interests them. Sometimes it’s an ad.”    
 —Howard Gossage
	No matter how boring your product looks, it doesn’t mean you can’t tell your story in an interesting way. Making it interesting is a marketer’s job. All depends on how creative they are.
	We are exposed to hundreds of marketing messages every day, but we are not receptive to all of them. Most of them are ignored, and some are kept in our mind unknowingly. Those are the messages which have interacted with our subconscious. Marketers always want the attention of the audience and want to keep something in the viewer’s mind. In order to achieve that, they use various techniques that are associated with a lot of Social Psychological theories and principles.

Attractive Colors and Packaging

	Our brain processes visuals 60000 times faster than text and 90% of information transferred into brain is visual. In this context, colors are a critical fact than we thought. As the researches driven on color psychology in relation to marketing, consumers spend just 90 seconds to make up their mind on some particular product and 62% to 90% of that decision is influenced by the color of the product. Another study discovered that having an attractive packaging causes to make intense brain activity than having an unattractive packaging. While the unattractive packaging makes active the area of the brain associated with negative emotions, the attractive packaging increases the activities of the area associated with positive emotions.

Reciprocity Principle

	In nature, humans have a trait of giving something back when something is received. When you give away something first for free, if it’s helpful, people feel a real sense of indebtedness towards you. This concept is widely used in marketing. The thing you give, it doesn’t have to be big. Maybe it is just a toothpick! But it will make customers feel good. Being nice to the customer is always good and it will cause to raise the brand loyalty among customers.

Foot-in-the-door technique 

	Get customers to commit to a smaller request first, and then go for the big one. Sure, you may see these kind of advertisements - “Try 30-day free trial” and “Experience the uniqueness, first day is free”. They invite customers to have the experience of their product for free. It lets the customer to understand the value of the product, and if they get satisfied with it, they can purchase the full package. As per the researchers, this technique has 50% rate of success.

Framing effect

	Always try to emphasize the positive side of the product over the drawbacks and shortcomings. How you frame the information you present on your website or in your ads will change the way people react to it. A very slight change in language can have a huge impact on the decision-making process. Suppose you are in a critical illness and doctor recommends a surgery. He says, 

1.	“You have 10% chance of dying after the surgery”
2.	“You have 90% chance of surviving after the surgery”.

Definitely second one will make you feel better. Because it has framed positively.

Conformity Effect

	Humans are social species. They always worry about what others think. Unintentionally, people try to conform themselves to the way others behave around them. For example, think of a situation where a group of friends are buying ice-cream. All of them prefer chocolate ice cream, and only one wants to buy a vanilla ice-cream. Most probably, that person will change the mind and buy a chocolate ice-cream just as the others because, he doesn’t want to be different. That is the conformity effect.
Create Scarcity and Urgency
	“Limited seats available, Reserve your seat now! Only 30 tickets left” these kinds of ads perhaps be familiar to you. Creating scarcity invites people to take quick decisions. It implies “tickets are selling quickly” and makes the audience to think “others are interested in buying, why are you not?”. This type of feeling leads people to buy something (conformity effect). 
	
Mere Exposure Effect

	When someone is exposed to the same thing again and again. It will lead them to develop a preference for that thing despite what they thought about it first. This technique is widely used at political campaigns. 
	These are only a few key principles used in Social Psychology. Psychology and marketing has an unbreakable bond because, marketing is all about delivering messages into human mind and psychology is about understanding behavior of the human mind. In some countries, there is a job title called “Marketing Psychologist”, and they consult marketers with psychological analysis about consumer behavior. That makes sense about the importance of Psychology in marketing.  There are plenty of researches that have been carried out on the intersection between human mind and marketing. That is because, before creating compelling content marketing, it is highly important to learn how marketing would compel the consumer’s mind in the first place.  A marketer can affect consumer decision making, only if he can understand the behavior of consumer’s mind. Learn the art of reading the consumers.

 Does the world need real leaders???

“The leadership instinct you were born with, is the backbone. You develop the funny bone and wish bone that go with it” 
– Elaine Agather

Have you ever thought about how a real leader behaves? Qualities of the so called “leaders” in our society undoubtedly mare our idea of real leadership while some of them inspire us to read about the vision behind a true leader, and the others are busy giving new dimensions to our image of a leader.
Mahatma Gandhi played a charismatic leader’s role that Nelson Mandela and Barak Obama are looked up to, owing to the great leadership “traits” they embodied. “Is it possible to inculcate a passion for leadership?”. “Are Leaders born or made?” These questions have been denied conclusive answers, and are therefore, found to make “leadership” a little more mysterious. Recall a time you saw a fellow pedestrian meet with an accident; how many by-standers and how many volunteers to take the injured to a hospital, do you remember seeing? Do you find yourself capable of motivating others to get the needful done? How many of us make use of the opportunities that could put our leadership skills to test?  And how many of us simply watch them pass just because we can’t exert ourselves? Could you think beyond your boundaries?
“By definition, “leadership” is the ability to influence others’ behavior with or without authority.”
-Peter De Lisle
“Leaders become great not because of their power, but because of their ability to empower others.”
                                                                                                                                	-John Maxwell

Are leaders born or made?

Great Man theory and Trait theory suggest that people inherit some qualities and traits from their preceding generations that make them better suited to display leadership qualities while some believe the fact that any person could train himself or herself to develop leadership qualities.

Leaders are born not made

“To suggest that leaders do not enter the world with extraordinary endowment is to imply that people enter the world with equal abilities, with equal talents.” (Thomas Carlyle 1840)
Born or natural leaders are different from trained or artificial leaders. 30% of the characteristics in a person are predisposed; they are the leadership qualities a person is said to be “born with”. Almost all the remarkable leaders have a marvelous and great history regarding their performance. It is said that all kings should be leaders. However, all the leaders were not kings. In fact, some kings unfortunately failed to rule the country as illustrated by history, clearly because their leadership skills were not up to the expected level. Even though they assumed kingship, they had to step down in instances where the demanded qualities conflicted with the displayed qualities.  
Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela are two examples for leaders who led by taking risks. Ordinary people would obviously not be able manage such unwieldly risks or challenges. It is the passion to believe in goals that made them be real fuglemen among the ordinary.
If leaders cannot be made, what is the point of studying leadership and management? We are forced to look into ourselves by learning leadership, and trying to recognize the real leader inside us. 
Is it possible to build a leader after birth?

Leaders are made, not born

According to the behavioral theory, people could be made leaders through a process of teaching, learning and observation. Leadership requires a set of skills that can be learned by training, perception, practice and experiences. 
School leavers are guided to be leaders by Worldwide Universities and Higher Education Institutes. They try to give a birth to real leaders by providing many opportunities to display and develop leadership skills. Learning leadership in life is a lifelong process. Good leaders seek development opportunities that will help them learn new skills.
Leadership can be learned by anyone with an idea about basics; that’s the good news. The bad news is the fact that implementing theories is the hardest part of education. The qualities such as effective communication, listening to others and immediate actions to issues are enhanced leadership qualities that can be learnt or practiced. Some researches shed light on concepts which suggest that extroversion is frequently associated with obtaining and managing leadership positions and effectiveness. Leaders can inherently take risks; not only that, they are also assertive and are required to be SMART to analyze situations and problems and to figure out courses of action. So, intelligence to understand social situations and processes is the key component of real leadership. Manipulating a gun and shooting are not enough, winning depends on how close you could get to the target.  

Have you ever faced a situation where you were given some team work in your school, university or work place and the task got completed without the appointment of a leader? Someone comes out with leadership qualities. He or she communicates and moves with others very effectively. Leaders divide team members for tasks, and help them to do it efficiently. They understand the scenario first and analyze it to come up with the best solution by team building. Getting work done, by influencing others in an effective manner is the goal or objective of a leader.

Do we really have leaders in Sri Lanka? Leaders are among us, but they should be in the right place at the right time. You may be a leader, but it is indispensable that you be in a position that encourages and facilitates the growth of your skills. We see a need for real leaders in organizations, in industries, in the society, in counties and in the world.
Not everyone could be real leaders just like everyone cannot be good actors. All the books which present theories about leadership, classes, education and training cannot transform a follower into a leader. Great leaders are passionate about what they do, live with integrity, led by example, develop a winning strategy, are experts in great team building and inspire followers to greatness. They can see the big picture and work towards the goal they build.
As Sri Lankans we know that many politicians are stepping forward to rule the country. Addressing audiences and expressing their perceptions are nothing compared to taking actions at the right time. Citizens face many critical circumstances due to the lack of real leaders. Leaders who are only denominatives do not focus on challenges and the difficulties of populace. They appease situations after an issue arises. To be frank, it’s hard to identify a real leader to rule the county at present. Leaders should not be puppets of others. Not only should they be capable enough to be independent but also be able to manipulate authority in a correct manner. If a person manipulates his or her power incorrectly or beyond the boundary, that suggests the fact that they are not leaders, but dictators. 
Leadership is always a choice among a crowd. A leader is a person who comes forward to take the challenge. If a leader rises up from the community, then that person has already become a leader to begin with. If someone has had the best training, education, social conditions, behaviors and opportunities, but rather prefers to be hidden in the crowd, unwilling to participate, he or she is not a leader.

Leadership style is not a static concept; it varies with many factors. Experience of a leader is the weapon that helps him or her be a great leader. 

To you, I present the century old debate “Are leaders born or made?” What is your take on this? Researchers have found that people who are more curious and ambitious have a great strength to be leaders. Ask yourself! You are either a leader or a follower. You cannot be both in one given context. Are you willing to be a leader or not?  The choice is yours.

Recall playing games and earning digital money online? The MMO gamers surely do. Despite their intrinsic value, the demand for them is typically limited to other gamers. But have you ever imagined a digital currency, demonstrating a global demand as a medium for exchange? It is not future. Cryptocurrencies are already here. 
Cryptocurrencies presently have become a phenomenon known to many people. While some still find it convoluted and not easily understood, most of the global banks and companies are well conversant with its presence and importance. 

ENLIGHTEN YOURSELF: CRYPTOCURRENCY

During late 2008, cryptocurrencies came to life as a side product of an innovative project undertaken by Satoshi Nakamoto. In its essence, cryptocurrencies exclusively rely on a decentralized peer-to-peer network for both transaction process and validation with no central governing agent. Is it really possible to achieve the consensus in the absence of a central authority? Surprisingly it is. Nakamoto’s invention has perfectly answered that query. Double spending; a transaction error in which a single digital token is spent twice is prevented through a mechanism where all the nodes of the network are engaged in lieu of a central governing agency. 
Cryptocurrencies are more or less similar to fiat currencies (paper money or coins) intended to function as a medium for exchange. So does it have anything to do with cryptography? Yes, indeed! The soundness of transactions and regulation of addition of new units for circulation is corroborated by cryptography. 

INSIDE OUT

A cryptocurrency is merely a SHA-256 hash. Wait! What is a SHA-256 hash? 
SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm which is a family of cryptographic hash functions which takes an input returning a fixed size alphanumeric string. This is more or less a one-way digital fingerprint which cannot be decrypted back. This is what the technical description says. Let’s move back to where we stopped. 
A person’s cryptocurrencies are stored in a wallet; essentially a file, accompanied by addresses from and to which transactions were made, and a private key, known only to the particular user. A transaction is done by starting off a transfer request from an address (a hash) in the payer’s wallet to that of payee (simply X giving an ‘n’ amount of coins to Y). This is when the transaction is broadcasted over the so called peer-to-peer network for validation. 
Consequently, the particular transaction will be swiftly known by the whole network which requires a confirmation for it to be unforgeable. Confirmation thus is a critical concept in cryptocurrencies. This tentatively happens when a random SHA-256 hash comprised of certain properties is generated by a single node within the network. This process requires an extensive amount of processing power. Once confirmed, the transaction is irreversible, becomes a part of an entrenched log of historical transactions: the “blockchain”.  
Blockchain. Yet again a peculiar term. Isn’t it so?
Blockchain predominantly is a public ledger of cryptocurrency transactions that have ever been undertaken. It is continuously propagating as new blocks are being added with records of new transactions in a chronological order. Each node gets a copy of the Blockchain which accommodates information on addresses, and balances right from the root block to the most recent block upon joining to the network.
The node which generates the satisfactory hash is rewarded with new cryptocurrencies. This endeavor to generate validation hashes is known as mining; the sole means by which new cryptocurrencies enter the circulation. 
MINING MAKES YOU RICH

So we too can be miners…! WHY NOT? 

The block hashes are generated at a controlled rate by the design. Nevertheless, the rate may fluctuate depending on the variations of the network’s processing power as new nodes enter or leave the network. Along with the escalation of computer power being added, the complexity to generate a hash is increased. Simply, more the nodes in the system, harder a hash is to generate. Furthermore, a particular node once in a while may not ever generate a suitable hash. Bitcoin, the market leader as well as the most widely used cryptocurrency has a precise limit of 21 million bitcoins which is expected to reach around 2140. 
Mining being an utmost computational process, current mining software often require specially designed computer chips. Custom designed mining boxes are even available for this purpose.   
So you got the answer. With your ordinary laptop, you may end up with an electricity bill which surpasses your cryptocurrency revenue!

WILL YOU BE CONVICTED?

The legality of cryptocurrencies significantly differs from one country to another. While some have not yet recognized them as a medium for exchange, some have explicitly allowed their use. In 2014 the US Internal Revenue Service has declared that cryptocurrencies will be prone to capital gains tax. It was once stated in a paper published by Oxford scholars that cryptocurrencies depict attributes similar to precious metals in contrast to fiat currency. 
That being the case, what might be the situation in Sri Lanka? Despite the fact that cryptocurrencies have not been a hot topic here, according to an article on Daily Mirror, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has responded positively to an idea put forth by a top ICT official to introduce cryptocurrencies to the local financial system. 

WHY DOES IT STAND OUT?

The irreversibility is the most significant property of cryptocurrency. Once confirmed, the transaction cannot be reversed by any means. Anonymity is another strength of cryptocurrencies thanks to hash addresses. They being fast and global, trading can instantly be done over the network. The security is ensured with public key cryptography system making it impossible to break. Being an irreversible, permission-less and pseudonymous mean of trade, it is a menace to the control of financial authorities over the monetary transactions of public. 

THE MARKET IS MASSIVE

Cryptocurrencies are predominantly used outside the current banking system, more often in online transactions. This alternative method of trade contemporary has a distinctive potential to challenge the existing system of currency. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies as of 2017 is a massive multibillion dollar figure slightly over 100 billion USD! 
As of 2016, there were around 700 cryptocurrencies in circulation. Yet the market leaders are all early entrants. A particular cryptocurrency gains value as the number of users increase depending on the success of that currency. 
There is no doubt that cryptocurrency is a fascinating concept which already has the heed of cyber merchants. It is justifiable to foresee the day that cryptocurrencies will become the first choice in real world business is merely around the corner. More the time passes, the better it seems to be captivating.

      Gone are the days when we played military games, pretending to hear each other through intercoms; pushing our earlobes with fingertips and delivering all the messages. It is unimaginable how the world has changed into a place where everything is connected, through the years down the road. The world which had computers as big as rooms has now evolved into stage with people who wear personal computers on their bodies. Does it mean that devices could be embedded in the human body in future? Does that ring a bell of childhood intercoms that were previously mentioned? How far would device implanting technology take us? What are the existing facts which prove that implants will take us to a different world? 
      
Wearable devices have already become a new fashion in the modern era. In this world where everything is connected, every post-millennial has the perspective, “The more you wear the technology, the more will you become smart”. So it is logically predictable for implanted devices to be the next big bang in technology in the millennium. Microchip implants are available even contemporarily. According to Wikipedia, “human microchip implant is an identifying integrated circuit device or RFID transponder encased in silicate glass and implanted in the body of a human being.” The microchip contains a unique ID number which will be linked to a particular database which may contain personal information, contact information, medical history etc. There are certain hobbyists who have surgically implanted microchips in their hands and use them to access their homes, log on to computers or mobile phones, open secured elevators and doors, print from secured printers and even make payments. Furthermore, an implantable chip known as VeriChip or VeriMed is being used for medical purposes such as storing medical information in case of an emergency. Pacemakers that keep the beat of defective hearts and cochlear implants that ameliorate hearing ability in the differently abled are also presently available.
At some point in future, GPS-enabled chips could be deployed in the world to detect locations and direction of movement. GPS-enabled chips might lead us to create a considerable number of applications. They will help provide information about what we see and/or where we are. Since all the information about individuals would be stored in databases, only authorized people will get a chance to retrieve data collected through the GPS. It will create great opportunities in finding missing persons; parents might be able to find their missing children, the government, police or other related authorities could use this opportunity to find frauds and detain criminals. 
Some microchips have been implanted in workers of certain companies allowing the company to keep track of every move the workers make; the authorities have the ability to monitor toilet breaks and working hours of every employee in the company, allows the employees to open doors, use office equipment and appliances such as printers, photocopiers etc. With the advancement of these microchips, it would extend to a wide-ranging payment methodology where workers would be paid according to the number of hours they work, which could be monitored using the microchip, eventually enabling workers to make payments through the implanted microchip itself. Everything will be easier with the furtherance of automatic payments done by microchips. 

Such as microchip implants, neural implants are technological devices that could be placed on the surface of the human brain. Presently, research has found that neural or brain implants could be done to record the activities of the brain. Modern brain implants usually focus on damaged human brains. Those such as deep brain stimulation and Vagus nerve stimulation have already helped mitigate the effects of Parkinson’s disease, clinical depression and epilepsy. Creating interfaces between neural systems and computer chips is yet another application of brain implants. This will create the ability to restore vision, movement and hearing ability of the differently abled. In future, it would be possible to merge human intelligence with software in order to keep pace with the advancements of artificial intelligence; blur the boundaries between human intelligence and digital intelligence and connect them together, making a breakthrough of the capabilities of human beings. The development of these neural implants will help people control particular devices with their brain. This foresees a higher percentage of driverless cars on roads in future. In addition, it will enable disabled people to fully engage with the world, have the ability to control different devices hence, use their teaching and working skills, have endless learning opportunities and use autonomous automobiles. A huge transformation of medicine would probably be done with the development of neural implants. 

It should be mentioned that the smartphone has become an inseparable device which has literally become a part of our own body. Many of the researchers believe that “Phones in our heads” would be the most significant change in the upcoming decade. The Finger Phone is the latest proof that can predict that the concept of “Phones in our heads” would be the world’s next move. It is a wrist band that turns your finger into a phone which uses the vibrations in your body to direct the audio to your ear.  In fact, the first embeddable phone which uses wireless technology is expected to be sold by 2023 according to the proceedings of the world economic forum-2016 held in Davos, Switzerland. It is uncertain if features like text messaging, surfing the internet and swiping through apps would be available in these embeddable phones. Even though their functionality is unforeseeable, they would create great opportunities and challenges for humanity. 

Until now, our online presence has been a projection of ourselves. With wearable techs and implants, real time data from our physical bodies could be augmented to our digital footprint. This will encompass things that could keep track of the human heart rate, glucose levels, blood pressure and other physical figures. Huge amounts of data could be accumulated through these implants, personalized experiences could be collected using wearable techs. Using privacy settings, those experiences and real time data can be manipulated according to the sharing outlook of oneself. This advancement might change the configuration setting of “being online” too. 
The applications of human implants and wearable devices do sound like science fiction or a fantasy, but, could we neglect all the facts which illustrate the possibilities of imagining where the world is headed to? Unfailingly, this will be the most futuristic ‘eureka’ moment that humankind would ever witness. Once the developments and the legislations are done, the world will be shaken up. Even if this is a few years away, time will change behaviors, cultures, norms and many more things for human kind, starting at least with the most powerful tycoons in the world.

Ecstasy in its dictionary meaning refers to ‘an overwhelming feeling of great happiness or joyful excitement/an emotional or trance-like state, originally one involving an experience of mystic self-transcendence’. 

Sounds familiar?

This is something we all have experienced at least once in our lives after accomplishing a given task or winning a challenge. Most of the time this is a common feeling felt by the people who are engaged in playing games as once they achieve a task they feel motivated and this motivation is continued by leveling them up within the stages of the game and through the rewards given. 

Dope Souls!

The real cause for this feeling is a chemical which is synthesized in our brains called Dopamine giving oneself an emotional trance-like state which keeps him or her attached to continue the work until they successfully complete it. This also modulates reward prediction adjustments simulating the desire to do the activity over and over again which is called the ‘Dopamine drip’.
The biggest challenge in HR	
Whilst the work force of the world is taking up by the Millennial or the generation Z, the biggest challenging question human resource managing sector faces is how to keep people engaged in their work effectively with the booze of social media addiction.
A research carried out by Gallup Research center revealed that less than 2 in 10 employees are actually ‘engaged’ in their jobs whereas the remaining are either ‘not engaged’ or ‘actively disengaged’ which is fierce.
This is why the understanding of “human emotional behavior” is more important rather than measuring the physical factors by using traditional tactical tools to understand human behavior, and to identify their capacities.

Psychographics over Demographics

Demographics are what we generally use to identify human behavior through factual information such as gender, age, income etc., whereas psychographics use subjective measures such as personal traits, attitudes, and choices etc. to identify human nature. This is more effective in social research in analyzing a community.
During a research carried out by ‘World Winner’, an online gaming platform provider which involved more than 500 online players; they found out that 80% of them depend on games at working hours to stay focused. This in return implies that there is a faulty somewhere in recognizing the actual needs and behaviors of employees. 
What if we can keep employees engaged in the work with the ecstatic feeling felt by themselves through their own actions?

Gamification at work

The concept ‘Gamification’ has been roaming around the management fad for many years with some hype surrounding in it, but has not evolved much in the world of Human Resource Management yet. Many mistake this as gaming or having fun at workplace, but this is much more than just a game.
Simply, the overall concept of Gamification is making use of the gaming designs, game mechanics and its thinking in non-gaming scenarios like; workplace engagement and e-learning to keep users engage in the work through motivation and reward behavior.
A neatly designed gaming system is capable of tracking the players’ activities, weaknesses and strengths by displaying them through various visual aids such as leader boards, points, badges etc. In order to achieve these, there are many gaming elements which can be used such as quests, avatars, progression levels, social graphs and many more.
The history of Gamification runs for back to 90s. 
Among the first concepts developed, one which became very popular was the introduction of Mozilla open source badge kit, with digital badges where they allow users to record their achievements, view their failures and track their interaction in specific communities in various e-learning environments. This supported the learning environments by motivation and signaling achievements enabling them to get recognition, to verify skills and to share them across the web.
Apart from the badging systems, there are many other ways which can be linked to the gamification process through gaming techniques such as a ‘Points System’ which shows the points that should be collected by the player to further the levels and ‘Leader Boards’ which is a representation of the database of scored points. It allows the player to view the scores later and compare them with the other players. Leaderboard defines what a score means in a game.

Your game your way

A gamified workspace will utilize the maximum of the competitive plunge which employees have within themselves while they become more engaged through the sense of achievement. It will even increase the willingness to achieve new levels while helping them to stay motivated. Therefore, this would be a shift for the employees from their regular monotonous working schedule to give them an extra boost to their motivation and to keep them engaged.
Also, this would change the fundamental ways of how a business is done in evaluating, promoting, recruiting and firing employees etc.
When we consider the gaming process, there are clearly visible steps to be seen on accomplishing the mission of a player’s journey. They are;
	Discovery
	   Onboarding
	       Habit building
		 Mastery
These very same steps in gaming could be used in organizations for better performance.

Why game mechanics …
Training
The success of gamification in e-learning environments has already been proven.  Therefore, organizations can use gamification processes to offer different personal and professional development routes integrated with other aspects of work.
Recognition
The status at a workplace is much important to an employee just as much as the financial rewards that he or she receives. The feeling that they are doing a good job at the workplace and the recognition by the senior management is an add-on to keep them going.  What is best about gamification is that this happens automatically allowing friendly competition among the employees while letting them identify who has performed well and who has drifted off through leaderboards, badges etc.

Motivation

A neatly designed system will allow everyone to view feedback, personal benchmarking, get recognized within the community and communication among them while enjoying the possibility to improve.
Feedback
Taking or giving feedback will no longer depend upon the time or the mood of a person. The results will be real, and hard data will help the organization to picture their accurate performance. Leaderboards will allow the users to understand what they need to do for the improvement.

Mastery

One main reason why people always love playing games is the chance given to an individual to develop a certain skill which is also one of the important aspects at the workplace. Gamification allows an employee to learn new things and to experience how things which were challenging before can be done easily with flow.

In the context of the business environment, Amazon (Sales ranks), LinkedIn (profile strength progress bar & endorsements), Stack Overflow community (reputation points) and many web-based platforms have already adopted this new outlook, enabling them to change people’s behavior and pattern of thinking in purchasing, bidding, giving remarks, endorsing for skills and sharing information.
A good platform should not make the user feel like it is mandatory. Therefore, this will have to be planned carefully to get the desired results. Also, adopting this must be a part of larger strategy as it will influence the culture and performance management of an organization.
There is a plethora of ways how game techniques can be used with Gamification at the workplace to give extra boost to the degree of engagement and motivation of employees which will be the next revolution in the field of human resource management.

      We once lived in an era where people only expected the products to be functional as it was required. If it worked right, it was all they wanted. Then became another, where people were thrilled by new technological features in products. They were very satisfied by the mere capability of those products to finish the tasks fast, accurately and successfully. With time, this particular technology became rather invisible, since it was the core of the product.
The coat of the product; design, which was neglected in the past, sooner became a core ingredient. People started expecting good user experience which ended up in demanding sophisticated digital products, rather than being only smart. They wanted the product to be doing what is assigned while offering the pleasure alongside.
This is where visual design comes to reside within building up User Experience (UX). While the user experience incorporates the whole concept of making the product interactive, visual design makes sure that the product is visually aesthetic and representative. 
Visual Design is the collection of visual components used in the design of a product, such as colour, space, typography, lines and shapes, contrast and balance. The combination of these should make a product accessible, understandable and pleasing. 
Once the colours are applied, elements are aligned and wording is done, the design process cannot be considered to be over or perfect. The design is meant to be started with the product design and to be ended with the completion of the project. Visual design must be an ongoing process, because the design will never be complete or perfect with the changing design requirements. 

“First impressions are 94% design-related.”
-	www.researchgate.net

Peeking into the importance of this – Visual Design – within the boundaries of UX, there are various reasons one would not easily think of. First and foremost, though we admit it or not, the visual elements make the first impression on the product, in user’s mind. Most probably, this might even lead the user to make the decision of continuing or discontinuing the use of a particular product. Would you rather wait for a second chance to make that first impression?
Studies have found that the majority of the users attend to the visual cues more than the actual content of the digital product. This might lead to a discussion of what actual use there is if the users are more into the coat rather than the body. Yet, the ultimate conclusion would be that if you want to hand your product successfully to your customer, you should never ignore the User Experience which you are offering along with.
Another important thing comes along with this, is branding. Knowingly or unknowingly, you offer your entire brand with the design elements of the digital product. From colours to typography, to spacing and even to the balance of elements, it represents your brand. That is where one should consider visual design to be prioritized than ever. The days are coming where the users will be first looking at the design rather than checking out the content, because now that the technology has become an essential, users believe that it is already and perfectly out there. It simply means that designers are to present the taste before the users actually taste it.

“People ignore design that ignores people.”

Behind all these, what would be the obvious element? It’s none other than one’s own mind. We, in this world, do everything to be compliant with mindsets, just because it is when the things are most acceptable. Visual design is no difference; people like to see, hear or feel what their minds want to. Psychology plays a major role in designing since visual aesthetics and interpretation heavily depend on perception.
In the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), visual design holds a prime position as it directly deals with the human psychology. Cognitive models to be associated with design have been introduced. Design guidelines have been made incorporating the cognitive psychological facts. For example, reception of colours and related views vastly depends on the diverse factors of humans such as cultural, demographic and even scientific. To work with these differences, sets of design standards and principles which are related to cognitive factors and primarily based on the perspective, were brought up. When designing for general, the guidelines and the standardization became really important for a better experience. 
Visual metaphors are another thing which was influenced by the relationship of visual design and psychology. Humans tend to find the familiar things even in an unfamiliar environment. This is because of the brain’s ability to remember and recognise. One good example of relating this into visual design is iconology. Icons are mostly designed as the reflections of real-world objects. They metaphorically refer to the concepts that are familiar to the user. Icon of Recycle Bin reminds the user of the physical dust bin and it implicitly reminds of the functionality as well. 

“Visual Language – Language of Dreams”

This emphasis on psychological aspects of design has been an influence for the emerging of a rather fascinating concept – Design systems – or simply, visual languages. World’s pioneering digital product manufacturers such as Google and Microsoft are now stepping in to the competition of introducing diverse design systems, yet based on the same primary principles.
A design system consists of certain guidelines for a better user experience, including usage of colours, white space, lighting, typography, depth and balance and many more. Basically, it is a derivation of visual language which is as any other language yet communicates with visual elements. In a well thought-of design system, there are unified set of design rules and patterns that if used, offer a significantly intuitive and friendly user experience.
When talking about design systems, currently, the most popular and widely-discussed system is Material Design by Google. It was introduced in 2014 with the code name of ‘Quantum Paper’ since its primary concept was ‘Paper-and-Ink’. Material Design relies on light-weighted materialising of the visual elements, synthesizing the classic design principles with innovative technology. It is expected to be a single underlying system that allows for a unified experience across platforms and device sizes.
While Material Design became one frontier visual language, Microsoft presented a rival – Fluent Design. It was built on Microsoft Design Language 2, incorporating five main design elements as building blocks. Fluent Design is said to be more interacting with mixed reality with sensory experiences, while Material Design focuses on tactile reality inspired by real-world objects, along with sleek and smooth materializing. Yet, according to many critics and reviewers, Material Design has had a head start with its universal, consistent and easily-adaptable design system, while Fluent Design is often criticized as a close resemblance of Material Design, except for its said capacity to work well in 2D and 3D. Other than these two hottest development trends, digital leaders such as Asus are also coming up with their own design systems.

“Where is Visual Design headed?”

The day when people will prefer aesthetically pleasing visual design over anything, is not so distant. Agreed by the designer community all over the world, now people believe that the digital products must contain what is required and therefore the delighting components – the design – should also be there at no additional effort or cost. What customers require is a sophisticated digital product which should be able to please the user with its unique delighting capabilities, demanding higher expectations from UX.
Now that new technological trends such as 3D motion art, design elements developed for Virtual and Augmented reality have entered the design arena, professionals in design are expected to be competitive than ever. Even the visual artists and 3D motion designers have shifted to UX designing recently, just seeing the huge demand. For example, Perception – a big motion graphics company, has recently moved into designing UI for tech leads such as Samsung, Microsoft and Ford. Users expect irrational UI designs and amazing UX with the products which emphasises the fact that visual design would come forward playing a major role in UX.
In near future, it will never be enough for a user of digital products, to have the best flow of the activities, accurate functionalities or mere completion of what is required. It will always be the delightful design which was only a decorator earlier but, now comes up as a primary need, that would please the user, tapping the art, aesthetics and the creativity in mind.

      Every organization in the current volatile and dynamic business environment is trying to survive the long run while also maximizing their profits. The healthiness of any business entity is reflected upon its balance sheet. It tells how much a company owns and how much it owes. Despite the standing given for the economic indicators, the world describes the human resources to be the most important asset of any organization. However, have you ever seen human capital listed on the right hand side of a balance sheet? It is highly unlikely that you may have seen such a sight. Most organizations fail in assessing the value created by their human assets. If the companies are capable of quantifying or measuring the strategic value that the intangible assets are adding to its business, they can optimally invest in them in order to generate a higher return on its investment (ROI).
Any investor will think twice, thrice, and even more than that before investing in a business entity. The entrepreneur should elaborate on the profit margin that the business is going to earn, the number of shares and the dividends that the investor is expected to receive. The investor is likely to invest confidently in the initiative if the entrepreneur is capable of convincing the investor about its potential in profits and survival. Likewise, if the company can ensure and clearly define how the human resources are expected to add value to the organization’s ROI, they could optimally invest in their intangible assets in order to maximize the gains in the long run.
Foremost action before investing in the human capital is measuring the strategic value created by them. Measuring must not be done just for the sake of measuring. The outcome of the measurements must support the organizational goals and objectives. These measurements estimate the contribution of the intangible assets to the company’s overall strategy. Mostly, the intangible assets are involved in the transformation processes where tangible resources are converted into desirable tangible products and services. Therefore, the impact of the intangible assets could be measured when the organizational strategy is in execution. If the importance of the intangible assets in the strategy execution has not been correctly evaluated, they will create a lesser value than the amount of money that has been spent on enhancing them.
Recruitment and selection process in HRM plays a vital role in acquiring the RIGHT asset to a company. Main inflow of employees to a company is handled by recruitment and selection process. Therefore, effective recruitment can strike a balance between employee inflows and employee outflows by minimizing the employee turnover. EFFECTIVENESS of the recruitment and selection process could be enhanced if it is incorporated with more analytical or optimization tools, and rationalize the intuition based decision making which is mostly used in HRM.   When the applicants have applied for the vacancies in different positions, Analytical Hierarchy process incorporated with multi-criteria decision making could be used to evaluate each applicant against different criterion of each vacant position. After the evaluation, each applicant will receive a priority score where it can be used in linear programming or any other optimization tool and determine whom should be hired or which position should be filled with how many employees in order to achieve organizational goals under a minimum cost. 
Human capital is known as the legacy that the employees bring in to the organization and the contribution made by them to the organization. Moreover, the human capital defines a pool of knowledge, skills, capabilities, experience and motivation level of the company’s workforce. The organization’s pool of talents should be competent enough to be actively involved in the critical internal business processes. This is termed as the Strategic Readiness by the Harvard Business Review. If they are not competent enough, it is where the optimal investment in training comes in to play. After acquiring the talents, it is the HR department’s duty to develop them. The training manager holds the responsibility in deciding the most needed and optimum training programs to be implemented in the next year. First, he should have a thorough understanding about the organizational goals. If the internal capabilities are inadequate to achieve those goals, necessary training programs must be arranged to fill the gap in competencies. In any company, resources are limited. Training manager will also get a limited budget to train the employees. Within the given scope he or she should decide which training program to be implemented, and how many employees should be allocated from each department. Analytical tools and optimization algorithms will pave the way for HR manager to effectively cope up with this issue. Ultimately, organizational resources will productively be utilized and generated better ROI from people.  
The process of job evaluation bridges the employees’ effort in job performance and the output of the job. HR department prepares the remuneration package for each job after evaluating the quality of the job. Though some companies use experts to do the process of job evaluation still they have not been able to find a better way to allocate their financial budget for paying their employees. Subjectivity and biasness in human decision making may lead to unfair evaluation results which may also lead to dissatisfied employees and at the end, lower performance for the whole company. Job evaluation incorporated with Multi-criteria decision making will determine the value adding proposition of each job to accomplish the vision of the organization.  Therefore, it will make the HR manager to be more confident about his or her decisions about the company’s remuneration system. This effort will design attractive benefit packages which will fulfill employee wishes and create a reduced balance in the expenses of the income statement. 
Apart from basic statistical analytics mentioned above, “Big data analytics” becoming one of the buzz words in the current business world has printed the first huge step towards the next industrial revolution dawn to an information era. Big Data is often making a difference in areas you never expect, particularly in Human Resource Management. According to the Harvard Business Review, 71% of CEOs surveyed believe that human capital resource is the most important contributing factor to sustainable economic value. Human Resource managers could use HR analytics in order to predict the turnover risk of the company. It will reveal who and how many employees are going to quit in the coming future. This will be a remedy to mitigate the effect of a severe turnover catastrophe. Businesses with a high turnover rate loose a huge sum of money as they have invested in talent acquisition and development who may leave the organization soon. Therefore, it is apparent that organizations equipped with data analytics could decide rationally about the optimum investment on human capital. This further leverages for a competitive edge to be marked as unique among other companies. 
All above stories say Human Resource Management needs meaningful analytics and metrics which are aligned with organizational vision and objectives. Still HR departments are slow to get on board with big data, but if they are ready to be on the game, they will be the core caretakers and contributors of the company’s ROI. The international researches and surveys have emphasized the importance of using analytics and metrics when deciding the investment on human capital. According to a study by KPMG an audit and Advisory firm, three-quarters of executives think that human resources policies based on data analysis will improve company profitability over the next three years.
Significantly, it depicts Human capital, the most precious asset of an organization which has not gained the deserving position in the balance sheet has an immense potential in creating a better ROI in the long run. The only effort that needs to be put in is to think, and act logically and rationally, use the power of information to make justifiable decisions, not just wage decisions based on intuition. HR professionals should not lag behind, they should be competitive with their peers from marketing, production and other departments. They need to attentively engage in improving the ability of analytical thinking. After that, particular thinking will enlighten the flourishing journey towards a profitable future with a powerful rationale behind. With the active involvement statistics and analytics, the optimum investment of limited resources on strengthening the talent pool will be highly facilitated. Ultimately, the CEO will be easily convinced by the HR department to view and feel the beauty of the glamorous picture which is going to be fabricated for the first time and never have been imagined of by the CEO.

											 -	John Patterson – 


At present, many companies are continually trying to improve their current products and services and concurrently looking to invent new products, services and processes. Even though Research and Development is a good strategy that can be initiated to fulfill this process, it comes with risks and challenges in hand because it can be costly for the company to carry out internal projects, resulting in missed opportunities for the company. Then, how can a company reduce its Research and Development costs while accomplishing the objective of innovation? One successful option is to identify external sources of innovation to reduce the costs of internal R&D. As Neil Deverill says, “procurement are integrators”, bringing together internal and external stakeholders to help create value and in this particular instance, drive collaboration and then innovation.
Innovation has become a key factor for the success of a company. Previously, innovation has been considered as the basic way for a company to maintain a competitive position in its marketplace. However, lately, companies not only focused on internal innovation, but also began to identify and take the advantage of external sources for innovation. In point of fact, the greatest untapped potential for innovation lies within the supply chains. 
Among the external sources, suppliers can be recognized to possess a special innovation potential that the company can take advantage of. Even though the suppliers hold the mechanism, it is questionable whether the suppliers will actually transfer innovation to the customers. Thus, collaborative supplier innovation comes in place. 
Collaborative supplier innovation mainly aims at maintaining a good relationship with your suppliers where they feel motivated, and even comfortable, to bring in new ideas to the table. However, commencing with innovation without first enforcing collaboration, can ultimately result in the failure of your supplier innovation aims and objectives. Kevin McFarthing says, “So how should you approach Open Innovation if your company does not have an inherently collaborative company? The answer is – wait. The focus should be on introducing collaborative ways of working first”. Therefore, you should first ensure that the business has developed a culture and a structure which supports supplier collaboration before proceeding with innovation and focus on the win-win from the offset. 
 Towards Win – Win Situations
When the suppliers have collaborative relationships with the companies, they are more willing to share their innovative ideas and technologies. If the collaborative supplier innovation is well managed, the company can gain profitable growth through lower costs, improved speed and differentiation.  The company can maximize its opportunities in gaining innovations from the suppliers’ skills, capabilities and knowledge and thereby increasing the company’s competitive advantages in the marketplace while strengthening and improving the suppliers as well. This will build confidence among the two parties in the stability of their working relations and to work collaboratively in an increasingly trusting manner. 
 
Challenges and Best Practices
Successful SEI is challenging because most of the companies, take this as a cultural shift. Though the supplier/ customer relationships become collaborative, still there may be conflicting objectives which have adverse effects on it, finally resulting in distrust among the two parties. For an instance, while the company and its supplier unselfishly work together to share their innovative ideas and thus improving the mutual trust, the cost-out mindset of everyday sourcing may cause problems, because, if a need arises to reduce cost, both the parties will try to steer the negotiation to their own advantage. As a result, stress will be created and this will finally lead to distrust and the suppliers limiting their transferring of innovations to the customer. Therefore, the company should focus more attention towards many aspects in mitigating the potential issues that can arise. 
At the initial stage, before proceeding in SEI, the company should make sure that it is regarded as a customer of choice by the supplier. If you are not a key account for the supplier to work with, and if the supplier does not trust you, then your entire approach may collapse at the very beginning. Therefore, make on-time supplier payments, be open with the supplier and maintain prompt communication. Moreover, as mentioned above, supplier collaboration comes before supplier innovation, and for this to take place, stakeholders must be perfectly aligned. This internal stakeholder alignment will make sure that the information flows smoothly between the individuals and the teams in your company. At the same time, there will be greater value generated if the procurement function is involved at the initial stages in idea generation and idea implementation.  This formalized approach will ensure that the key stakeholders have the catalyst that is needed to drive innovation. The most important aspect for Supplier Enabled Innovation and open innovation is supplier connectivity. Procurement has to be perfectly positioned to link the external capable suppliers with the internal stakeholders; through internal stakeholder alignment, this link can be enhanced. Furthermore, technology is always becoming more powerful and thus it is the key enabler for delivering supplier innovation. The businesses which use technologies are able to deliver a real Return On Relationships (ROR). 
To gain the maximum result from collaborative supplier innovation, the company should first shift the procurement mindset from “cost – out” to “profit – improvement”.  Thus, the traditional roles and responsibilities will be changed into different areas such as hiring and training staff to be more capable of evaluating supplier innovation capabilities, introducing systematic innovation management methods to select suppliers, establish new KPI indicators to measure supplier innovation performance etc. 
In the automotive industry, for example, supplier willingness to share technology is a major differentiator of successful supplier/ customer collaborations. Thus, Tesla, which has scored high in the areas of Trust, Ease of working, openness etc., is believed to be the innovator and drives technology to the supply base. The organization has gone so far to develop the Tesla Motor Supplier Portal, a platform which allows the company and its suppliers to share information over a secure internet connection, allowing this supplier/ customer relationship to flourish. 
Therefore, with the current complicated supply chains with integrated globalization, a new approach is needed for you to work seamlessly with your suppliers and unlock previously unrecognized innovations which adds new value to your company. SEI is a modern concept that the procurement function is once again trying to own, and it will be a catalyst which drives innovation and change. Therefore, is it not the time you started looking at your suppliers as a strategic asset rather than a burden??
