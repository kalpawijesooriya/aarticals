1.How do you define Chandani Bandara as a person and as an entrepreneur?

Actually I’m Chandani Bandara. I’m a very good entrepreneur and I’m not
Money minded. I always think about others’ happiness and their economy as well as my economy. At my workplace my carrier is more towards a mother than an entrepreneur.

2.	Did you always aspire to be an entrepreneur? What paved your way into it? What do you think is the turning point of your life?
Yes. 

From my childhood onwards I had the desire to be an entrepreneur and a leader one day. I’m the youngest of my family; for fun, all of my elder brothers and sisters bullied me. Because of that the desire of being a leader to all of them was implanted on my mind. I’m a quite radical character in my family. My thoughts were quite different from others. That’s why even from my little age, I had the dream to provide jobs to others.
When I was reading to my bachelor’s degree in Natural Sciences, in Canada, as for my part-time job, I was a cleaner at a salon. There I was inspired to select this profession, which paved the way into succeeding in this carrier.
So afterwards, I suddenly resigned from my job and started this journey with a small salon. I believe that as the turning point my life.

3.	What is the portfolio under the brand “Chandani Bandara”? Tell us about your venture.

We have many sections under our portfolio. “Chandani Bandara” Salon, Chalmway Academy, Forever Skin Natural Factory and under foreign businesses we have 2 Salons.

4.	What challenges did you face when initiating your brands and how did you overcome them? What were your strengths and barriers?

As a beautician, initially acquiring the recognition by the local customers was a challenge for me. At that time this field was not very much popular. There were only few well known beauticians in the country. So, reaching to that position was a big deal. But gladly the “Sirikatha” Newspaper made me popular overnight. But, I have to emphasize this; actually that time I had a simple knowledge about this field. But with that simplicity, I put my full effort for the completion of every task. So, people embraced me with their hearts.
Next Challenge was the foreign brands. When initiating FOREVER brand, that challenge was huge. Not only that, the flank attacks from the competitors also influenced a lot. But I believe I have a powerful strength and I do face them successfully.

5.	Criticisms are common in any field of irrespective of the differences. How do you handle the criticisms tossed at you?

I like to be criticized. Actually, criticisms can carry two things. Short termly, it may hurt you but, long termly it strengthens you. I learn from criticisms. I correct my mistakes from them. I have excelled my talents from them. Even the quality products of our brand are results and researches of the criticisms given by my customers. Criticisms carry lots of energy to life. So criticisms are really good for me.

6.	Your brand clearly stands out from other brands in the market. What do you think sets you apart from other similar brands?

Our products are real herbal, real natural genuine products. That’s the main reason to stand out from others.

7.	You say your biggest competition is from foreign brands that are marketed inside the country. Why do you emphasize that?

I believe that I don’t have any competition locally. I do respect all of them. But, the imported brands seem to be the biggest competition because of the mythical belief of good quality in imported products than local products in the mindsets of local customers.

8.	Beauty care is a field which is very crucial in customer satisfaction, so how do you maintain your market share under such conditions?

We only use FOREVER beauty care products for our customers in the salons. But if the customers insist on using different product rather than FOREVER brand, we gladly supply that service for them, so that our customers would be satisfied with what they get. The thing is, usually our customers prefer herbal, quality products and the reason why they are always with us is that our main focus is on herbal, pure natural products. We promote our product and try to increase market share by that. We also have other promoting methods like Buy one - Get one free, targeting that the customers would do a second purchase, hoping an increment in our market share while doing so.

9.	You always point out the importance of the recognition of beauticians as a major group of entrepreneurs in the country with which we agree. What is your take on that?

A beautician himself is an entrepreneur. That is actually undebatable. No matter the beauticians are rich or poor, they can be entrepreneurs in their own ways. They may have a crew behind them with whom they proceed further with the products and workings. What I believe is that a beautician is the best entrepreneur who doesn’t become a burden to the society and they are the people who bring out the beauty within people and earn their livings in a very humble manner.

10.	You have diversified into many areas in this industry. Starting an academy deals with a different need in the society. What was your intention behind this?

When I first tried becoming a beautician I did not have a proper place to learn the tactics and the strategies. I went to several places in order to learn, but it was all useless. When people enter a university, the environment for the undergraduates become totally different. They tend to learn more, with good quality levels with a better environment there. So I wanted to create the same environment for those who are willing to contribute for the beauty care field too. I wanted to let them practice the methods practically so that they would have better experience with that and so, one day the dropouts would be armored with expert quality in the field.

11.	What approach did you take to enter the European Market? How did you differentiate?

When I started the interview with you, I mentioned that our product basis is real herbal and pure natural. That’s the main difference between our products and European beauty care products. Most of the International products do promotions without specifically targeting a proper theme on beauty care field. But our intention is majorly on promoting herbal basis product promotions. We use herbal concept rather more specifically. Now the world is trending towards the herbal products and so it’s actually better for our own products. And I believe we are at the correct position of the competing road ahead in the European Market. But unfortunately in Sri Lanka it’s the opposite.

12.	How do you feel about the competition for your own brand in International Market?

Yes of course, it’s really good and definitely we are on the right track.

13.	You provide employment to so many Sri Lankans. And you take measures to uplift the personal lives in contrast to many other entrepreneurs in the country. How would you encourage other entrepreneurs to have a similar vision?

I’ll provide an answer for this question with an example. When concentrating on herbal based products turmeric seed has a very rich property which most people aren’t aware of. We go to farmers and buy the turmeric seeds where gradually those farmers themselves become entrepreneurs. Now many employees are working under those farmers and so they have improved their businesses. It’s the same with the farmers who cultivate Aloe Vera for our products. So this is how we encourage people to become entrepreneurs.

14.	According to your own point of view, what makes you stand out as a leader among the others?

Let me take you back to my childhood to answer that question for you. As I mentioned earlier, I was the youngest of my very big family, so I was always bullied by my elder sisters and brothers. That was the first time which stroke my mind to be a leader. Many people who call themselves as leaders were followers beforehand. But, what I did was, I created my own path with all the experience I had got. I had to handle 150 labors at first all alone as a leader. As I understood as a leader was that what those people needed most importantly was love and caring, which I simply gave them with my whole heart. They are really trustworthy people and most of them still work under me with the due respect for me. If full time workers are unable to work any further, I give them with another option as part time workers where I get the total workforce in return which makes me satisfied as well. I have a smile on my face when I come early in the morning to work and I greet them with a “Good Morning” which I know in return spirit up the young workers early in the morning.


15.	Do you think being a woman made it hard for you to succeed in the business?(How did you overcome them?)

Being a woman in this field actually provides me with lots of pros and cons. There is a lot of respect for a woman in the society, whereas women are easily offensive, sensitive type human characters as well. I am really very proud to be a woman. Even my husband works as the CEO for my company where I am the chairperson and many other men works under me in the company making me so proud myself. Many problems arise while working, that’s true. But, I being a woman face them with a brave heart, without easily getting down emotionally. Also when there is a chance, I grasp it very tightly where it profits me. So I believe generally being a woman is being lucky.

16.	What are the current constraints for female entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka? Why?

 My advice is don’t listen to any of them. If somebody restricts me of something, what I usually do is rather do the opposite of what they say. I really am a total stubborn character.

17.	How important it is to have a support system as a women entrepreneur?

For a woman the family support is more than anything. Luckily I have a well-educated husband and a family which paved this way for my success. My next gratitude goes to my staff. To balance the life and to reach to the desired position, that support system always must be there.

18.	What advices do you have for Sri Lankan young entrepreneurs who are willing to enter into local and international product market?

You should be honest. That’s the most important thing. You should look in to the lives of the successful entrepreneurs, identify the specificities, study them and develop them within you. You should develop your personality too. You should always be with clear aims. You should grab the skills and values which you need to be succeeded in your aim while travelling in this journey.

19.	What are your future plans for the expansion of your portfolio?

Now I’m planning to open a factory in Australia and to provide jobs for Sri Lankans. I’m thinking about the export industry too. On the other hand, I’m thinking about the production of good quality pharmaceuticals in Sri Lanka.

20.	You are a professional beautician, a teacher, an entrepreneur, a chairperson and a mother. If someone wants to think about you as a role model and develop their characters, what are your advices for them?

You have to have many experiences. Bad people means good experiences. You have to educate yourself for your dream. Trust others carefully, keep personal things to yourself only. First decide your ultimate goals, work hard for it and never make excuses. If you fall it’s done. So toughen your mind, never ever loose opportunities and anyhow achieve your targets. Do good. Be with your religion .Look after your family and the staff. Enjoy this short life. Past is past. Forget it. Think about today’s matters today. Think about tomorrow’s matters tomorrow. Balance your life. Your limitless courage and effort will pave the way for your success definitely."

      1.	Attune is a professional global consultant, how would you introduce your business and its activities? 
      
If you look at Attune, we are a global SAP solution provider. We are exclusively focused on fashion and life style base. We don’t work in any other industry. It’s purely this base that we operate. Our scope of services goes across retail companies, brand owners and manufacturing companies like MAS. We provide services across the entire value chain in the industry.
We are in 11 countries and we’ve been operating for the last 12 years under the name “Attune”. We began our journey back in 1999 as being a part of MAS internal SAP team. Subsequently, we became an independent company back in 2002 under the name of Rapian. In 2006 we established Attune as a joint venture between 3 other partners. We continued as Attune over the last 11 years. Over the years we’ve been extremely fortunate to have worked with the biggest brands in the market. Starting from Adidas, Burberry, Timberland, Crocs, Rockport, Columbia, and Brioni. We’ve been very fortunate to have been worked with most of the fashion brands in the world. 

2.	This industry is dynamic and diverse. It demands a broad scope of knowledge about many areas. How do you handle this scope as the Chief Operating Officer (of attune)? 

If you take our focus, being in the fashion industry as well our focus on being a SAP solution provider, those are the two main areas we really need to help our teams to be successful. As a boutique organization our customers expect our team members to come in, help, guide them, advise them and support them in making the right decisions in SAP implementation. We have to be a trusted adviser. That’s the key differentiate we have among any other solution provider in this base. In order to do that, our focus on investment is in our people. We actually started this process way before someone even joins Attune. We work closely with universities to develop curriculums. We participate in conducting educational programs. All with the idea of creating awareness and giving people a set of tools, irrespective of whether they join Attune or not, to be able to understand at least what SAP offers and what career development opportunities are there within that space. Then subsequently, we look at how we can attract and bring the best talents into Attune. Unlike most of the companies, we invest a lot of time to develop those capabilities, both in terms of their knowledge in SAP as well as giving them the right exposure, experience in the industry because for us since we focus only on fashion and life style, our consultancy cannot only on SAP consultancy. They have to understand the business process, industry, they have to be able to add value to our customers. I think that’s where we differentiate some of the other service providers. We start off our process when someone joins Attune by assigning them a coach. They spend 6 months initially, undergoing a training program. We have a very detailed process identifying the area where they need to invest in developing by monthly quarterly checking with those trainees. Initially we give them the right tools and exposure within Attune Sri Lanka to gain the first set of knowledge required to be a consultant. SAP product knowledge, industry trainings, take them to factories like MAS. Help give them the right foundation to build their career on. We invest a lot of time here giving them an opportunity to work with our global customers in support may be doing projects from Sri Lanka, then customers in the region, and finally work with customers globally. This is a good experience for those who have an interest to develop their careers in SAP. We have lot of folks who started off their careers from universities in Sri Lanka and developed their skills here and working with all our global brands in US and Europe.

3.	Could you elaborate on your business portfolio, your partners and specify the services and solutions you offer to the market?

We focus on fashion and lifestyle. It covers bit of a broad spectrum. But essentially it’s whatever touches head to toe. What we actually cover is, the companies that are into apparel, even sunglasses, bags, shoes, accessories. Even though it’s a niche, it’s quite a broad area. In terms of our client list, again it’s quite broad. We work with high fashion companies like Burberry and Brioni, sports and life style companies like Adidas and Columbia, footwear companies like Rockport and Crocs. 
Primarily what we offer is SAP solutions, but at the same time we offer complementary digital solutions where we provide development of those solutions using mobile and web technologies, java.net etc. Sometimes there could be a need that we can’t fulfill using SAP. There could be a need for some peripheral solutions which is easily accessible by the user. Companies wanting to touch end consumers. There are also requirements where companies want to go back in the supply chain and touch manufacturing companies and supply chain as well. In those area what we found is there is a lot we can do in using development technologies to build more customized purpose-built solutions to address some of their requirements. So in terms of products it’s SAP and other development technologies. In terms of services, we are an end-to-end service provider. We are starting with advisory services for the customers. We provide project management and implementation services. We provide manage services which is a post implementation we can maintain and manage the entire system; both SAP and non-SAP applications from operations here in Sri Lanka and in India. We also provide custom development as well. So broadly it’s those 4 pillars. We also provide business transformation and change management services as well. So if you look at most SAP implementations, it also requires the company to change their business process. So it’s not only changing a system. It’s something that requires a lot of attention in order to make an implementation successful. If the business is not ready to adopt these changes coming in, or if the users are not aware of how their works going to change after the new changes come in, it can make a lot of changes for a company. So we also provide business transformation and change management services to help them to move into a new system by helping them to identify the impacts of the new solution and how to work in the new environment and all of those areas as well.

4.	What do you identify as reasons for your specialization in the fashion industry? 

There are a couple of reasons. First we born out of the industry. MAS being our parent company we saw how MAS was extremely successful by being a niche player. At that time, they were focusing on intimate apparel. They were able to create a specialization that made them the leader in that area. So, we thought without being a generalist and trying to cover multiple different types of industries, why you don’t focus on, at that time, apparel and footwear. It really built some skill that differentiated us from other service provider. At the end you go to the market and say “I can do everything”, you can’t differentiate your services or you can’t showcase the value you can bring into a project or to a customer. If you look at our position in the market, we compete with the last 5 consulting firms at this time. Where we create differentiation is, make the product is number one. We’re specialized. We know the industry. We know how to add value. Guild you and help you make the right decisions in terms of the implementation. At the end of the day it’s paid off. It helped us create a good name in the market.

5.	 With the high cost, you only can target the large brands. Do you have any other options for small companies?

I think it’s evolving. In past, it was mostly the larger companies that embarked on a SAP implementation. Now you see a lot more companies in that SME also implementing. But, we believe that there’s a certain threshold point. If you are a startup and a certain revenue point, you may not have the maturity required to streamline your processes irrespective of SAP or any system. At the end when you hit a certain growth point you need to have a strong platform. Otherwise you can’t scale, you can’t go into new geographies/ product categories, you can’t acquire new businesses. That’s where products like SAP come in. It’s an extremely strong platform. They have a good place where you can start building your foundation and adding more building blocks on top of it. 
In answering your question, “no we don’t work with any other solutions”. But what we have specifically for the small and medium segment is, that we have developed, based on our years of experience, pre-confidence solutions. Usually what happens is, we work really close with the customer. We try to understand what their main areas are and based on our experience we help to find them solutions. What we also have built the solutions that can fit 70-80% of a business requirement, based on our years of experience. What it does is, it drastically decreases the time that you need to implement it. Thus, it will reduce your investment cost. That’s how we support the small to medium segments.

6.	What types of technologies do you implement?

Like I mentioned before, on the digital and custom development side we have capability around mobile development technologies, iOS, android, web development technologies, we have .NET, java. We have all of that. What we believe is giving the right solutions based on what the customer requires. Most of the times customer expects us to advise them because of our experience. We have fortunately built some credibility around there, to even to suggest the right technology to use, based on what they want to achieve.

7.	Using what metrics, do you measure the progress of the company?

Any organization has financial sort of metrics to measure how successful you are. At the end of the day, for any business to be successful and to achieve their objectives you need your customers to be successful and, in order to your customers to be successful, your people need to be successful in doing what they supposed to be doing and adding a value. We spend a lot of time focusing on how to make our team and our people successful. What we need to do is, equip them with the right skills, competencies, experience, exposure to be able to be successful and that helps our customers to be successful. Those are interrelated. HR teams along with services, teams spend lot of time in identifying the areas to help people grow. We have carrier coach program internally, where every person is assigned a coach. There’re periodical check-ins one a quarter. The responsibility of the coaches is to make their coaches successful. 

8.	 “Fashion” is global and diverse in terms culture and the likeness. Your organizational culture should suit these attributes to be successful. What is your take on this?

Attune as an organization, being a service provider, all are consultants who understand the nature of our business. And the fact that you need to be able to work in different environments. For an example, if you go to a company like Burberry, their attire would be different. They have a different expectation in terms of how you present the service at the workplace. Saying that, those are easier things to address. But at the end of the day, both the customer and the service provider know that there are some cultural differences. We, as Attune, make sure that we respect those cultural differences. We’re very fortunate to work almost in 11 countries which gives us a very diverse set of people working within Attune. We have almost 11, 12 nationalities within the organization. Being within that cultural diversity has helped us work better in different environments. Saying that though, I think Attune or any service provider, we set that expectation within our organizations. And we make sure that we try our best to see what indicates well and that always a very proactive set of activities we do; when you bring two teams together there are team building activities that we start on projects to make sure that people understand the working models, how to work within that team structure, customer expectations and work well.
I think we’re blessed with having this diversity. At the same time, we have a very unique culture within Attune. Attune as an organization is very flat. Titles don’t carry as much weight as credibility. People at every level are hands on. All though we are globally dispersed, we work as one team. We have an understanding of regional work ethics as well.

9.	What sort of opportunities are available for graduates? What is your stand in the job market?

We have a broad spectrum. What we really look for is the right attitude, aptitude, being able to initiate things on their own and we look outside of the pure academics as well in terms of your ability to be a team player. Only that will help us understand how successful you’d be, not only within Attune, but also in our customer environments. In terms of all the other areas such as technical skills and softs skills, we can actually help to develop them. That’s something that we do quite a bit. We have lot of training in terms of technical skills, soft skills, presentation skills, communication skills etc. to develop a person’s profile. But, unless they have the initial building blocks and the attitude to be self-motivated, then it’s a bit difficult. So, we are looking for those qualities.  "
