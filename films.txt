1.How do you define Chandani Bandara as a person and as an entrepreneur?

Actually I’m Chandani Bandara. I’m a very good entrepreneur and I’m not
Money minded. I always think about others’ happiness and their economy as well as my economy. At my workplace my carrier is more towards a mother than an entrepreneur.

2.	Did you always aspire to be an entrepreneur? What paved your way into it? What do you think is the turning point of your life?
Yes. 

From my childhood onwards I had the desire to be an entrepreneur and a leader one day. I’m the youngest of my family; for fun, all of my elder brothers and sisters bullied me. Because of that the desire of being a leader to all of them was implanted on my mind. I’m a quite radical character in my family. My thoughts were quite different from others. That’s why even from my little age, I had the dream to provide jobs to others.
When I was reading to my bachelor’s degree in Natural Sciences, in Canada, as for my part-time job, I was a cleaner at a salon. There I was inspired to select this profession, which paved the way into succeeding in this carrier.
So afterwards, I suddenly resigned from my job and started this journey with a small salon. I believe that as the turning point my life.

3.	What is the portfolio under the brand “Chandani Bandara”? Tell us about your venture.

We have many sections under our portfolio. “Chandani Bandara” Salon, Chalmway Academy, Forever Skin Natural Factory and under foreign businesses we have 2 Salons.

4.	What challenges did you face when initiating your brands and how did you overcome them? What were your strengths and barriers?

As a beautician, initially acquiring the recognition by the local customers was a challenge for me. At that time this field was not very much popular. There were only few well known beauticians in the country. So, reaching to that position was a big deal. But gladly the “Sirikatha” Newspaper made me popular overnight. But, I have to emphasize this; actually that time I had a simple knowledge about this field. But with that simplicity, I put my full effort for the completion of every task. So, people embraced me with their hearts.
Next Challenge was the foreign brands. When initiating FOREVER brand, that challenge was huge. Not only that, the flank attacks from the competitors also influenced a lot. But I believe I have a powerful strength and I do face them successfully.

5.	Criticisms are common in any field of irrespective of the differences. How do you handle the criticisms tossed at you?

I like to be criticized. Actually, criticisms can carry two things. Short termly, it may hurt you but, long termly it strengthens you. I learn from criticisms. I correct my mistakes from them. I have excelled my talents from them. Even the quality products of our brand are results and researches of the criticisms given by my customers. Criticisms carry lots of energy to life. So criticisms are really good for me.

6.	Your brand clearly stands out from other brands in the market. What do you think sets you apart from other similar brands?

Our products are real herbal, real natural genuine products. That’s the main reason to stand out from others.

7.	You say your biggest competition is from foreign brands that are marketed inside the country. Why do you emphasize that?

I believe that I don’t have any competition locally. I do respect all of them. But, the imported brands seem to be the biggest competition because of the mythical belief of good quality in imported products than local products in the mindsets of local customers.

8.	Beauty care is a field which is very crucial in customer satisfaction, so how do you maintain your market share under such conditions?

We only use FOREVER beauty care products for our customers in the salons. But if the customers insist on using different product rather than FOREVER brand, we gladly supply that service for them, so that our customers would be satisfied with what they get. The thing is, usually our customers prefer herbal, quality products and the reason why they are always with us is that our main focus is on herbal, pure natural products. We promote our product and try to increase market share by that. We also have other promoting methods like Buy one - Get one free, targeting that the customers would do a second purchase, hoping an increment in our market share while doing so.

9.	You always point out the importance of the recognition of beauticians as a major group of entrepreneurs in the country with which we agree. What is your take on that?

A beautician himself is an entrepreneur. That is actually undebatable. No matter the beauticians are rich or poor, they can be entrepreneurs in their own ways. They may have a crew behind them with whom they proceed further with the products and workings. What I believe is that a beautician is the best entrepreneur who doesn’t become a burden to the society and they are the people who bring out the beauty within people and earn their livings in a very humble manner.

10.	You have diversified into many areas in this industry. Starting an academy deals with a different need in the society. What was your intention behind this?

When I first tried becoming a beautician I did not have a proper place to learn the tactics and the strategies. I went to several places in order to learn, but it was all useless. When people enter a university, the environment for the undergraduates become totally different. They tend to learn more, with good quality levels with a better environment there. So I wanted to create the same environment for those who are willing to contribute for the beauty care field too. I wanted to let them practice the methods practically so that they would have better experience with that and so, one day the dropouts would be armored with expert quality in the field.

11.	What approach did you take to enter the European Market? How did you differentiate?

When I started the interview with you, I mentioned that our product basis is real herbal and pure natural. That’s the main difference between our products and European beauty care products. Most of the International products do promotions without specifically targeting a proper theme on beauty care field. But our intention is majorly on promoting herbal basis product promotions. We use herbal concept rather more specifically. Now the world is trending towards the herbal products and so it’s actually better for our own products. And I believe we are at the correct position of the competing road ahead in the European Market. But unfortunately in Sri Lanka it’s the opposite.

12.	How do you feel about the competition for your own brand in International Market?

Yes of course, it’s really good and definitely we are on the right track.

13.	You provide employment to so many Sri Lankans. And you take measures to uplift the personal lives in contrast to many other entrepreneurs in the country. How would you encourage other entrepreneurs to have a similar vision?

I’ll provide an answer for this question with an example. When concentrating on herbal based products turmeric seed has a very rich property which most people aren’t aware of. We go to farmers and buy the turmeric seeds where gradually those farmers themselves become entrepreneurs. Now many employees are working under those farmers and so they have improved their businesses. It’s the same with the farmers who cultivate Aloe Vera for our products. So this is how we encourage people to become entrepreneurs.

14.	According to your own point of view, what makes you stand out as a leader among the others?

Let me take you back to my childhood to answer that question for you. As I mentioned earlier, I was the youngest of my very big family, so I was always bullied by my elder sisters and brothers. That was the first time which stroke my mind to be a leader. Many people who call themselves as leaders were followers beforehand. But, what I did was, I created my own path with all the experience I had got. I had to handle 150 labors at first all alone as a leader. As I understood as a leader was that what those people needed most importantly was love and caring, which I simply gave them with my whole heart. They are really trustworthy people and most of them still work under me with the due respect for me. If full time workers are unable to work any further, I give them with another option as part time workers where I get the total workforce in return which makes me satisfied as well. I have a smile on my face when I come early in the morning to work and I greet them with a “Good Morning” which I know in return spirit up the young workers early in the morning.


15.	Do you think being a woman made it hard for you to succeed in the business?(How did you overcome them?)

Being a woman in this field actually provides me with lots of pros and cons. There is a lot of respect for a woman in the society, whereas women are easily offensive, sensitive type human characters as well. I am really very proud to be a woman. Even my husband works as the CEO for my company where I am the chairperson and many other men works under me in the company making me so proud myself. Many problems arise while working, that’s true. But, I being a woman face them with a brave heart, without easily getting down emotionally. Also when there is a chance, I grasp it very tightly where it profits me. So I believe generally being a woman is being lucky.

16.	What are the current constraints for female entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka? Why?

 My advice is don’t listen to any of them. If somebody restricts me of something, what I usually do is rather do the opposite of what they say. I really am a total stubborn character.

17.	How important it is to have a support system as a women entrepreneur?

For a woman the family support is more than anything. Luckily I have a well-educated husband and a family which paved this way for my success. My next gratitude goes to my staff. To balance the life and to reach to the desired position, that support system always must be there.

18.	What advices do you have for Sri Lankan young entrepreneurs who are willing to enter into local and international product market?

You should be honest. That’s the most important thing. You should look in to the lives of the successful entrepreneurs, identify the specificities, study them and develop them within you. You should develop your personality too. You should always be with clear aims. You should grab the skills and values which you need to be succeeded in your aim while travelling in this journey.

19.	What are your future plans for the expansion of your portfolio?

Now I’m planning to open a factory in Australia and to provide jobs for Sri Lankans. I’m thinking about the export industry too. On the other hand, I’m thinking about the production of good quality pharmaceuticals in Sri Lanka.

20.	You are a professional beautician, a teacher, an entrepreneur, a chairperson and a mother. If someone wants to think about you as a role model and develop their characters, what are your advices for them?

You have to have many experiences. Bad people means good experiences. You have to educate yourself for your dream. Trust others carefully, keep personal things to yourself only. First decide your ultimate goals, work hard for it and never make excuses. If you fall it’s done. So toughen your mind, never ever loose opportunities and anyhow achieve your targets. Do good. Be with your religion .Look after your family and the staff. Enjoy this short life. Past is past. Forget it. Think about today’s matters today. Think about tomorrow’s matters tomorrow. Balance your life. Your limitless courage and effort will pave the way for your success definitely.

      1.	Attune is a professional global consultant, how would you introduce your business and its activities? 
      
If you look at Attune, we are a global SAP solution provider. We are exclusively focused on fashion and life style base. We don’t work in any other industry. It’s purely this base that we operate. Our scope of services goes across retail companies, brand owners and manufacturing companies like MAS. We provide services across the entire value chain in the industry.
We are in 11 countries and we’ve been operating for the last 12 years under the name “Attune”. We began our journey back in 1999 as being a part of MAS internal SAP team. Subsequently, we became an independent company back in 2002 under the name of Rapian. In 2006 we established Attune as a joint venture between 3 other partners. We continued as Attune over the last 11 years. Over the years we’ve been extremely fortunate to have worked with the biggest brands in the market. Starting from Adidas, Burberry, Timberland, Crocs, Rockport, Columbia, and Brioni. We’ve been very fortunate to have been worked with most of the fashion brands in the world. 

2.	This industry is dynamic and diverse. It demands a broad scope of knowledge about many areas. How do you handle this scope as the Chief Operating Officer (of attune)? 

If you take our focus, being in the fashion industry as well our focus on being a SAP solution provider, those are the two main areas we really need to help our teams to be successful. As a boutique organization our customers expect our team members to come in, help, guide them, advise them and support them in making the right decisions in SAP implementation. We have to be a trusted adviser. That’s the key differentiate we have among any other solution provider in this base. In order to do that, our focus on investment is in our people. We actually started this process way before someone even joins Attune. We work closely with universities to develop curriculums. We participate in conducting educational programs. All with the idea of creating awareness and giving people a set of tools, irrespective of whether they join Attune or not, to be able to understand at least what SAP offers and what career development opportunities are there within that space. Then subsequently, we look at how we can attract and bring the best talents into Attune. Unlike most of the companies, we invest a lot of time to develop those capabilities, both in terms of their knowledge in SAP as well as giving them the right exposure, experience in the industry because for us since we focus only on fashion and life style, our consultancy cannot only on SAP consultancy. They have to understand the business process, industry, they have to be able to add value to our customers. I think that’s where we differentiate some of the other service providers. We start off our process when someone joins Attune by assigning them a coach. They spend 6 months initially, undergoing a training program. We have a very detailed process identifying the area where they need to invest in developing by monthly quarterly checking with those trainees. Initially we give them the right tools and exposure within Attune Sri Lanka to gain the first set of knowledge required to be a consultant. SAP product knowledge, industry trainings, take them to factories like MAS. Help give them the right foundation to build their career on. We invest a lot of time here giving them an opportunity to work with our global customers in support may be doing projects from Sri Lanka, then customers in the region, and finally work with customers globally. This is a good experience for those who have an interest to develop their careers in SAP. We have lot of folks who started off their careers from universities in Sri Lanka and developed their skills here and working with all our global brands in US and Europe.

3.	Could you elaborate on your business portfolio, your partners and specify the services and solutions you offer to the market?

We focus on fashion and lifestyle. It covers bit of a broad spectrum. But essentially it’s whatever touches head to toe. What we actually cover is, the companies that are into apparel, even sunglasses, bags, shoes, accessories. Even though it’s a niche, it’s quite a broad area. In terms of our client list, again it’s quite broad. We work with high fashion companies like Burberry and Brioni, sports and life style companies like Adidas and Columbia, footwear companies like Rockport and Crocs. 
Primarily what we offer is SAP solutions, but at the same time we offer complementary digital solutions where we provide development of those solutions using mobile and web technologies, java.net etc. Sometimes there could be a need that we can’t fulfill using SAP. There could be a need for some peripheral solutions which is easily accessible by the user. Companies wanting to touch end consumers. There are also requirements where companies want to go back in the supply chain and touch manufacturing companies and supply chain as well. In those area what we found is there is a lot we can do in using development technologies to build more customized purpose-built solutions to address some of their requirements. So in terms of products it’s SAP and other development technologies. In terms of services, we are an end-to-end service provider. We are starting with advisory services for the customers. We provide project management and implementation services. We provide manage services which is a post implementation we can maintain and manage the entire system; both SAP and non-SAP applications from operations here in Sri Lanka and in India. We also provide custom development as well. So broadly it’s those 4 pillars. We also provide business transformation and change management services as well. So if you look at most SAP implementations, it also requires the company to change their business process. So it’s not only changing a system. It’s something that requires a lot of attention in order to make an implementation successful. If the business is not ready to adopt these changes coming in, or if the users are not aware of how their works going to change after the new changes come in, it can make a lot of changes for a company. So we also provide business transformation and change management services to help them to move into a new system by helping them to identify the impacts of the new solution and how to work in the new environment and all of those areas as well.

4.	What do you identify as reasons for your specialization in the fashion industry? 

There are a couple of reasons. First we born out of the industry. MAS being our parent company we saw how MAS was extremely successful by being a niche player. At that time, they were focusing on intimate apparel. They were able to create a specialization that made them the leader in that area. So, we thought without being a generalist and trying to cover multiple different types of industries, why you don’t focus on, at that time, apparel and footwear. It really built some skill that differentiated us from other service provider. At the end you go to the market and say “I can do everything”, you can’t differentiate your services or you can’t showcase the value you can bring into a project or to a customer. If you look at our position in the market, we compete with the last 5 consulting firms at this time. Where we create differentiation is, make the product is number one. We’re specialized. We know the industry. We know how to add value. Guild you and help you make the right decisions in terms of the implementation. At the end of the day it’s paid off. It helped us create a good name in the market.

5.	 With the high cost, you only can target the large brands. Do you have any other options for small companies?

I think it’s evolving. In past, it was mostly the larger companies that embarked on a SAP implementation. Now you see a lot more companies in that SME also implementing. But, we believe that there’s a certain threshold point. If you are a startup and a certain revenue point, you may not have the maturity required to streamline your processes irrespective of SAP or any system. At the end when you hit a certain growth point you need to have a strong platform. Otherwise you can’t scale, you can’t go into new geographies/ product categories, you can’t acquire new businesses. That’s where products like SAP come in. It’s an extremely strong platform. They have a good place where you can start building your foundation and adding more building blocks on top of it. 
In answering your question, “no we don’t work with any other solutions”. But what we have specifically for the small and medium segment is, that we have developed, based on our years of experience, pre-confidence solutions. Usually what happens is, we work really close with the customer. We try to understand what their main areas are and based on our experience we help to find them solutions. What we also have built the solutions that can fit 70-80% of a business requirement, based on our years of experience. What it does is, it drastically decreases the time that you need to implement it. Thus, it will reduce your investment cost. That’s how we support the small to medium segments.

6.	What types of technologies do you implement?

Like I mentioned before, on the digital and custom development side we have capability around mobile development technologies, iOS, android, web development technologies, we have .NET, java. We have all of that. What we believe is giving the right solutions based on what the customer requires. Most of the times customer expects us to advise them because of our experience. We have fortunately built some credibility around there, to even to suggest the right technology to use, based on what they want to achieve.

7.	Using what metrics, do you measure the progress of the company?

Any organization has financial sort of metrics to measure how successful you are. At the end of the day, for any business to be successful and to achieve their objectives you need your customers to be successful and, in order to your customers to be successful, your people need to be successful in doing what they supposed to be doing and adding a value. We spend a lot of time focusing on how to make our team and our people successful. What we need to do is, equip them with the right skills, competencies, experience, exposure to be able to be successful and that helps our customers to be successful. Those are interrelated. HR teams along with services, teams spend lot of time in identifying the areas to help people grow. We have carrier coach program internally, where every person is assigned a coach. There’re periodical check-ins one a quarter. The responsibility of the coaches is to make their coaches successful. 

8.	 “Fashion” is global and diverse in terms culture and the likeness. Your organizational culture should suit these attributes to be successful. What is your take on this?

Attune as an organization, being a service provider, all are consultants who understand the nature of our business. And the fact that you need to be able to work in different environments. For an example, if you go to a company like Burberry, their attire would be different. They have a different expectation in terms of how you present the service at the workplace. Saying that, those are easier things to address. But at the end of the day, both the customer and the service provider know that there are some cultural differences. We, as Attune, make sure that we respect those cultural differences. We’re very fortunate to work almost in 11 countries which gives us a very diverse set of people working within Attune. We have almost 11, 12 nationalities within the organization. Being within that cultural diversity has helped us work better in different environments. Saying that though, I think Attune or any service provider, we set that expectation within our organizations. And we make sure that we try our best to see what indicates well and that always a very proactive set of activities we do; when you bring two teams together there are team building activities that we start on projects to make sure that people understand the working models, how to work within that team structure, customer expectations and work well.
I think we’re blessed with having this diversity. At the same time, we have a very unique culture within Attune. Attune as an organization is very flat. Titles don’t carry as much weight as credibility. People at every level are hands on. All though we are globally dispersed, we work as one team. We have an understanding of regional work ethics as well.

9.	What sort of opportunities are available for graduates? What is your stand in the job market?

We have a broad spectrum. What we really look for is the right attitude, aptitude, being able to initiate things on their own and we look outside of the pure academics as well in terms of your ability to be a team player. Only that will help us understand how successful you’d be, not only within Attune, but also in our customer environments. In terms of all the other areas such as technical skills and softs skills, we can actually help to develop them. That’s something that we do quite a bit. We have lot of training in terms of technical skills, soft skills, presentation skills, communication skills etc. to develop a person’s profile. But, unless they have the initial building blocks and the attitude to be self-motivated, then it’s a bit difficult. So, we are looking for those qualities.

      1)	According to your perspective, who is Mr. Pulasthi Wanniarachchi?
      
Pulasthi Wanniarachchi, according to some, is an SEO Engineer, and the others, a Digital Marketing Consultant. However, according to my perspective, a human being who is involved in digital work. 

2)	Apart from the qualifications you have obtained, have you felt like you needed to develop your skills further at any point of your career? If so, what were the challenges you faced while developing them?

Yes. A SEO Engineer, requires to learn   theories about and practice things on webs and the like. But, to keep up with current trends, you have to know   more about SEO sections, how to do digital marketing, so on and so forth; it’s a continuous process of   refreshing knowledge, as I see it. The theories that are applicable today, expire tomorrow. So, you have to “google things” to learn more, “do experiments” as demanded by your career, to keep up. If you can’t move with new knowledge and gather those; you can’t move with digital marketing and web marketing technologies.

3) What were the inspirations that guided you to where you are today?

For me, “Inspiration” is self-motivation, self-learning and the related. When I stepped into the industry as an SEO engineer, there were only a few people in Sri Lanka who knew the area and practiced as SEOs. So, I had no option but to self-learn. As I’m always self-motivated; I didn’t need anyone to back me up or guide me. I referred online tutorials etc. and gained awareness about the digital culture and knowledge- online, continuously and by myself, which eventually paid off.

4) Did you target at being an SEO engineer from the very outset of your career? 
If not, what led you to take the path you did?

SEO is a new trend for the Sri Lankan culture, though it had been introduced to and prevalent in the world since twenty or twenty-five years. In fact, even the internet has used it. But, after my A/Ls and my degree, I think it took around six years for me to learn about these and practice online. To lay it precisely, I didn’t have a dream of becoming an SEO engineer in my childhood; even though I loved to work with computers and all, I never dreamt of becoming an SEO engineer or a Software engineer. 

5) SEO has been the ultimate buzzword in the field of IT; evolving swiftly, yet the application of SEO remains challenging but also, unique. In your point of view, why is the task of an SEO engineer important in the current context?

In my opinion, it could be simply viewed as, “without an SEO, there is no point of having a website”; because, first of all, you need to know what the website is to be, how to create a website for your product or service. So, without knowing these things, there is no point of having a website. First of all, you have to know the needful points; what you must publish in your website, before the creation begins. For that, in my perspective, you need to have five pairs of eyes; those of a Designer, a Developer, a Content Writer and an SEO Engineer as well as those of a Network Engineer. The purpose of a network engineer, being the provision of security as there are many hackers in the present digital world; as much as those who hack around sixty thousand websites per day. So, you have to have security as well. After building your website, you need to have an SEO Engineer or a Digital Marketer; the latter because SEO stands only for “Search Engine Optimization” whereas “digital marketing” entitles Search Engine Optimization, Search Engine Marketing and Social Media Marketing. In the  current world where many social media platforms are available, it is important that you have a skilled SEO engineer or a digital marketer, when you wish to market your product or service; this will help you to go online and present your website to the target audience, get more visitors and leads for your product or service.

6) In your opinion, what are the current trends in SEO? What does the future hold for it? Other than the existing fields, what avenues, do you think, are available for SEO engineering to expand into?

Through the year 2017, SEO saw trends like, the need to have quality content and the need for content to be unique. This is particularly because uniqueness and quality play a crucial role in determining google ranks and because google doesn’t allow anyone to duplicate anyone else’s work; using blogs that review and capture content that are copied from another site and notifies you, through google webmaster. So, those  come first, then comes the mobile optimization part; nowadays many people use mobile phones, smart phones, tabs and many such devices, it is needed to optimize websites to suit the mobile world, or make them “responsive websites”. Responsive” means, you can simply view the website in laptops, tabs and other mobile devices. Then, for visual optimization, they have introduced Infographics and Image Optimization which are new concepts to Sri Lanka, in contrast to other developed countries. So, you must practice these when you develop websites. For example, making YouTube videos or small types of clips or other product or service based clips, appear on YouTube and also in other video channels could make your product or service market massive and wide.
You also must have an “eye catchy”, user-friendly website. Without fulfilling primary requirements like those, there would be no point in having an SEO Engineer or in getting the SEO stuff done. If you have a dull looking website without having proper images or a user-friendly environment, people may visit, but leave your website immediately. In the Current context of things, CEOs decide whether or not to buy your product in a matter of seconds by viewing your website. These are the main trends in 2017.

7) Taking a quantum leap, you came up with your own personal brand ‘SEO Pula’, last year. What was your idea when you started this? Tell us about the beginning.

When I left my previous company, I thought of having my own digital marketing consulting firm to serve Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan business community through the things I had learned and the experience I had gained to help the digital era of Sri Lanka. That’s what I’m still thinking about. I could work in a free environment and do new experiments for the present generation while conducting good awareness programs through Digital Marketing in Sri Lanka. That’s why I decided to build a firm like “SEO Pula”.

8) Where do you see” SEO Pula” in the future?

My target is to build awareness and to build a proper digital marketing organization in Sri Lanka, to build and serve the country and help the business community appear on the internet and digital platforms and grow their businesses through those.

9) SEO is a new concept to Sri Lanka. Are there sources through which an interested individual could learn about it or obtain a related qualification from? What are the possible paths to enter into this field? 

At present, there are institutions that offer courses on digital marketing and similar subjects. When I started, there wasn’t any place to go to, to learn these things. Now private institutes as well as government institutes offer a subject called “E Business”, through which they try to give knowledge about this area to students who are willing to learn. But, if you aspire to become an SEO Engineer, you should have self-motivation and self-learning skills within you, added to the ability to work continuously. Otherwise you can’t achieve great things. You will have to know the product/service well and how to market it online. You may know all the theories, but when you go to the market and apply those theories only, will you be faced with problems. Because the final outcome lies in practically applying the theory to a product or service. Otherwise it can’t acquire a massive, eye catchy market; the best thing to do is to work on it and do so- continuously. Otherwise you can’t achieve goals in this area. It is accurate to say that your inner self should be self-motivated, working continuously and self-learning, if you are to achieve big goals in this area.

10) What are the current opportunities for SEO Engineering in Sri Lanka?

The number of opportunities are increasing because Blue Chip Companies and other companies in travel & hotel trades, financial businesses, news and media are looking for people who know about digital marketing and SEO; because they  have digital culture in-house and need to promote themselves in the current world through websites and social media. So, if you are a person who knows these things you have good opportunities in many such areas and more; even in job websites you could see more vacancies and a higher demand for social media marketers, social media executives as well as SEO Engineers and Digital Marketing Managers. Knowing this is good to brand yourself too.

11) What are the areas SEO Engineering has a chance to expand into, in Sri Lanka?

Many companies are expanding their products with which, “the need to promote” increases. Marketing trends are such that; people wish to save time; they don’t want to go to a boutique or to a shop or a supermarket to buy things, they love to sit in front of a computer and purchase the products they need. So, if you have an SEO Engineer for your product or service, he/she will make the product and show the product to the customer who is looking for the product or service. Even small business will have big opportunities through this digital marketing culture.

12) What are the differences you see when you compare yourself with the present young generation? What is the advice you could give them? 

The present young generation has grown up with social media, they seem to want to know and show their events and everything on social media, individually and in groups. My advice to the youngsters is, do your level best by trying to learn more about which ever the area you are studying and apply the knowledge to benefit yourself as well as the country. You may wish to leave this country and go to a better place, but, before that, do something for your country from your knowledge and give something back to the country. For you, it will be a source of self-satisfaction. That’s what I wish to ask from the young crowd.

13) You have started a new career path with your own organization. What are the challenges you had to face when you started the organization?

Yes, when you start a new organization or a firm, you will face many challenges like acquiring a new market and having trusted clients and all. You may meet good people along with a few who are bad. You will have to know how to manage those people and market yourself. You need to be honest while you are doing the job. You can’t misguide your clients; everything will be visible online. So, what we do is; building good relationships with customers, giving a good service, parallel to support services. It doesn’t matter if you are at home or at a party; it doesn’t matter if you do SEO or Digital Marketing, if you have a device with you, you can do it- from anywhere, anytime. So the best thing is to be loyal to your customer and to show   the best result to him or her.

      1)Share us your background on the inception of “Arimac” and the vision behind it.
      
We started Arimac in 2011 with the vision of being the geniuses of digital interactive media. We wanted to create a unified platform for technophiles and creative researchers who wish to come on board and play in different digital innovations. 

2)How did you come up with the term “Arimac” and how was the team “arimac” formed?

The term ‘Arimac’ is the reversed spellings of my first name ‘Chamira’ with the omitted ‘h’. However, now we have a team of 55 members working with us. All the members are from various backgrounds. We have engineers as well as creative designers working with us. So it’s a hybrid team that we have, with lots of passion and good hearts. Basically, those are the criteria that we look into when we are recruiting new members.

3)During your undergraduate years, you have bagged a series of competitions around the world. Would you like to share your experiences on such competitions like APICTA and NBQSA?

Back in 2007, I won the young computer scientist award which was awarded by British Computer Society and I represented Asia Pacific Society in the same year. Thereafter, I won different entrepreneurship awards including the entrepreneur of the year for digital innovations and so on.

4)Tell us about the experiences on your early projects “Kadapatha”, “Amma” and “Kundalani”.

Kadapatha is a multi-touched table which is basically based on FDI frustrated total internal reflection where we make an array of lots of IRs and do a lot of computer vision engineering in order to understand different touchpoints. We won many awards for that “Kapadatha” research project as well.
Amma is a very special project for me. It is a stress management system for pregnant mothers in their prenatal and postnatal stress stages. We were one of the top 5 finalists in Microsoft Imagine Cup in 2011 for that project. 

5)“Arimac” was implemented in 2008, at a time when ‘gaming’ was a rare sector to invest in. What made you do so?

In the year 2008, we started our venture as a virtual company which later got incorporated in 2011. 
If I am to answer your question, risk is something I always take in my life. In 2008, there were a few number of companies that modulated creativity with technology. We saw a vacuum in the region we live; Asia Pacific. The main challenge we had to face was that, different clients had different perceptions about digitals in that era. Therefore, we had to take different clients from abroad and do different projects for them and then we proved our skills which eventually helped us land our local projects. Actually that’s how we got acquired different clients.

6)Arimac has a very diverse set of operations in it. How do you approach these different functions at the same time?

We always strive to have this boutique environment. We have four key segments that we focus on. One is the web & mobile enterprise where we do lots of websites, enterprise, middleware and mobility solutions for different clients. And we do BFX and computer graphics which involves 3D animations 3D movies etc. We have a separate segment to do game developments and to provide gamification services for different clients along with our game products as well. We also have started a new ring Arimac Cognitive where we do a lot of AI and many other different deep learning technologies. Those are the key areas which we have used to diversify ourselves in our portfolio. 

7)What is your biggest break as “Arimac”? (He’s talking about breakthroughs)

SLPL or Sri Lankan Premier League; we got this project from Bathiya & Santhush. They were handling the SLPL event. They had a requirement for time shifting live stream for 10 minutes. Those days, there was no such software available and the only solution possible was a hardware which was very expensive. So, we coded a software which could time shift a live stream by 10 minutes. That was the breakthrough project for Arimac and because of that project we had a good cash flow to our company and our growth started. 
Another breakthrough is meeting Mr. Anthony Rodrigo, CEO of Dialog Axiata. He understood our passion and talent in this pace and he gave us a lot of opportunities to do different projects for them. That’s how we entered to this market and now we’re catering our solutions for Emirates as well. So we have gained a lot of international clients because of Mr. Rodrigo.

8)“Kanchayuda” became a well-known brand among the youth around the world. Why did you decide to launch it free in Sri Lanka?

First of all, we have had free education and all our members are from Sri Lanka. We also wanted to motivate young game developers and software engineers to do something like this. So after releasing Kanchayuda multiple gaming startups has started which eventually proves that our motive is achieved to a certain extent. Why we have started this is to reduce the brain drain. Lots of young, extremely talented and creative people, mostly the engineers are going abroad. Hence, if we want to have this country to go where we expect it to, we need to have a pool of talented people. Lot of people here are getting a lot of international job opportunities. But, they are choosing to stay here to do something for our own country. We’re cloning ourselves in Sri Lanka and while trying to make a good digital eco-system and a digital economy despite of the government fluctuations. We’re not a government agency and we’re neither related to the government sector which helps us to be very neutral in terms of government activities. But, we’re trying to enhance and help young budding entrepreneurs in terms of showing them that these goals are capable to be achieved in Sri Lanka. That is one of the main motives we had when releasing Kanchayuda for free.

9)Do you think that “Kanchayuda” was able to take you to your desired targets?

No. Kanchayuda is only 1% of the entire pragmatic target or dream that we have. Kanchayuda 2 will be released early next year. That will be published either by a big publisher or it will be published by ourselves as we did before. It’s a juggle that we have. Anyway, we have multiple international publishers onboard to publish the game. In 2019, we will be releasing our first animated movie which will be on par with the international films as well. Modulating all of that will be our desired target we want to achieve.


10)Majority of your projects are based on the values of the Sri Lankan heritage. Don’t you think that it will hinder your global market approach?

Yes, it is hindering my global market, but, it is uplifting my mother tongue and mother country. So I don’t mind hindering my money. I want to take the Sri Lankan brands, Sri Lankan keywords to the world. We know that Ceylon tea is much popular in the world. Just like that, when it comes to the digital or gaming industry, Sri Lanka should be one of the main focal points in the world. That’s the thing we’re trying to achieve. We have done projects like Kundalani, Kadapatha and Amma. Also we have this gaming protocol called imiGames, where we have more than 50 Sri Lankan games. So, it is true that it will hinder us, but it will take our motherland to the next level. So, we don’t mind.

11)“Adventures of Tia” is at the verge of being launched. Give us a little insight on it and share us your plans for it?

“Adventures of Tia” is one of the flagships in Arimac, where we do a lot of innovations. It’s a 3D animated movie which will be released in 2019. But, we haven’t published it yet because every day we’re uplifting the technology stack that we’re using. In the meantime, we’ll be releasing a couple of games for consoles PCs and mobiles. I’m not disclosing much information because that is one of our flagship products. You will see more in the future.

12)It was interesting to learn about your latest applications in Human Computer Interaction, which is a very fresh field to Sri Lanka. What made Arimac invest in such a sector?

At my university times, I was extremely involved in human computer interactions. It shows how the humans interact with different digital devices and interfaces, mapping brain waves to computers, the ways of mapping human gestures to computers and how the touch systems can be mapped to computers. I was an early adapter on gestural computing and I was collaborating with the top universities in the world to do different researches especially in Microsoft Kinect. We were an early adapter in terms of framework and testing. I have more than a decade experience on how EEG works, how mind works and how we can map brain waves into computers, understanding emotions. There are extremely hidden projects under Arimac that we’re working on huge BCI projects where we’re trying to centralize knowledge and memory. It will take at least 5 years but, will be a massive breakthrough in brain computing.

13)What do you have in store for “Arimac” in the future?

We’ll be releasing the first 3D animated movies by 2019. Then we have 12-15 international game titles to be released by 2020. In terms of AI, we will be releasing deep learning engine as a platforms during this year as well. We already have 2 clients for that, but we’ll be releasing it as a product in December. There are a couple of things that is to be released because, we’re working on different complexed websites which we’ll be releasing. Arimac is a service company. In 2020, we have a pragmatic approach to be benchmarked with all those international creative publishers as well. We have a very pragmatic approach towards that. So, we are working passionately and cognitively towards that.

14)What do you owe the success of Arimac to? /How do you see Arimac in future?

Arimac is a family so if I see a success all my members should have a better life. That’s one of the things that we always look into. My family members should always be in the highest level in their lives. In terms of the company, we have a very extremely pragmatic approach to be the leading interactive media content development and publishing company in the world by 2028. Therefore, those are the things I foresee for Arimac to go in the future and also we have the never giving up attitude. Whatever the challenge or obstacle we’ll be having in the future we’ll make sure that we face them with a positive attitude and make mother Lanka the hub of digital innovation. We have an amazing pool of engineers here. We have all resource persons here and all universities, but, the issue I see in Sri Lanka is, the perception. They are going for money in the first place. But, if you chase success and knowledge, then money will come. That’s the perception we need to make. All the Silicon Valley people, what they do is they innovate, they think and they manage and execute. But all those South Asian people are the people who are really developed. So that, we have the talent to be developed, so, we need to make a nation where they think out of the box.
 We’ll never will be a product company because we love services. But, under our services, we have a huge product layer going on. So that’s the sustainable approach or model that we have taken in order to sustain the business. So, mother Lanka should be like that. We have to have an amazing digital economy. We’re receiving lot of dollars from different countries to mother Lanka. So, I think all companies should do that. And then, despite of any fluctuation, if all those intellectual people can come onboard and make one platform where it creams out all those dollars to Sri Lanka, our country will be the most beautiful and the most talented digital innovative hub in Sri Lanka. So that’s the pragmatic approach or whatever the dream that we have towards 2028 will be subset of all these. So, our entire goal is to get our mother Lanka’s name as the most innovative digital country in the world. 

15)What were the downfalls, which you encountered during the past six years of Arimac? How did you overcome those?

I don’t take anything as a downfall. It’s all obstacles or challenges that we’re facing. So we have this ego or the moral that we never give up. Whatever the obstacle or challenge that life gives us we’re always reacting in a positive way and we achieve to the greatest height that we always want to go. So there are no such downfalls, but everyday we’re getting different obstacles and challenges where we love them because those are the things that keep us going towards our goal.

16)What is your advice for an undergraduate who is interested in gaming, AI etc.?

Basically, for an undergraduate they need to know whether they want to start their own business or find a co-founder who can run a business and help him or work for a big corporate. Whatever the path they choose, they need to have a passion. If you like painting, you need to be a painter. Not a singer. There are inborn talents that you are getting. Some qualities can be acquired through experience and knowledge. First, you have to understand which area suits you the best and you need to choose that. The main thing an undergraduate should do is finding the right path to walk through, rather than trying to do everything. I know for a fact that in Sri Lanka they’re doing Fiverr and all those freelancing things, but they exactly hindering their future. They’re working for $5 which will block the path to earn $500 per hour. I know that they have financial issues. I understand. But they should find a way to learn and earn money. What our people do is they work all day, but they don’t learn. That happens to different Asian countries. We really need to eradicate that. They need to find a way to learn and earn money.

      1.	You are a person who has engaged in, and excelled in many areas of work (like technical management, management trainer, R&D executive, technical operations and projects, managing director, founder/CEO, chief innovation officer and so forth.) what do you identify to be the sources for this capability?
      
First part which I do not agree; “that I have excelled in any areas…” To answer your question; First, it’s the mind set you have. Nobody is born like that as at birth everybody is same. According to what my mother says, your mind has to be tuned so that you see things differently.  Then the people around you; the way they think about something helps in how you develop your mind. When you are around with people who think differently you will also start thinking differently. In the university you can study and pass the exams easily, but the way you think of a problem is based on who you spend time with. Regard to that I was very fortunate with the people I have met my parents, lecturers, mentors and my first job which opened me up for many experiences at field, which tuned my mind set to see things differently and innovate. I would like to mention those as the sources for who I am today; mindset and the people who was around me.

2.	As we all know, the creative potential of childhood diminishes as one ages. What would you offer as advice to keep the creativity alive in a person?

The creativity doesn’t die naturally, it is forced to.  Mostly, the Sri Lankan parenthood is good at building fear at first place in childhood preventing those trying new things. But, once they grow up, they want the child to succeed and stand out among others achieving things. Many couldn’t do this as for that, they have to take risks to do things, and to change and innovate. So, in my opinion the creativity doesn’t die. It’s within them. Only thing is you need to find the opportunity to sharpen it. Therefore, the parents should be more cautious about how their children are being guided at small ages so that they will be raised to different level ones they start schooling.
And in the current context the accessibility for the technology is growing up so fast giving many opportunities for the young crowd like you to learn. It’s your choice to decide how you are going to utilize it, to grow yourself so that it sharpens your mindset.

3.	What inspired you to discover and pursue a brand new area of work, and become successful in doing so?

Something which I always look for is easier ways to do things; not in a way to cheat, but my first thought on this area when I started this was how I can get what I want to make, in the fastest possible way.
Handling and programing CNC machines and vacuum casting are complicated processes. When I discovered 3D printing, it allowed me to do the things I couldn’t do so far allowing me to discover new areas of work and to provide innovative solutions for the problems that my clients bring to our work space every day. That is how the idea of starting 3D printing studio came to live.

4.	What are your vision and mission regard to the current state of Industry? 

We have many of our citizens at the top most companies, which make us all proud as Sri Lankans. Even once, we used to build the fuselage for A380 aircrafts here, which is a confirmation that we have lot more potential than we think. My mission with regard to this is to bring the concept of 3D printing to a state where it can be accessed by everybody to be used for extreme R&D and to examine advance-engineering processes, to build and innovate.  Simply, with a tomato you will cook something with tomato, but with a whole set of other ingredients you will create something amazing so, with the patriotism I have for my country my vision is to put Sri Lanka on the map by giving the accessibility for the newest technology specially, for the undergraduates like you.

5.	Apart from being the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, what else could you state as your uniqueness?

Being the first is not something important because it will not do any good if we keep emphasizing on that. So the uniqueness is we always try to think out of the box for the goodness of the society and for the people who come to us with various requests. We have many customers coming daily, giving us very specific challenges to improve. So our specialty is we listen to them and we look for a way to disrupt the current state of their manufacturing process or any other activities so that they can grow and improve faster. Because the little changes we do will create a huge value for them, may be in terms of profit, process or people.


6.	For a layman, how would you show the applicability of 3D printing to their own businesses? What are the areas in the industry that can integrate 3D printing?

Let me answer this through one of our customers who came to us. An old fellow came to us and asked for his requirement. He wanted to build a plug which will never get burned due to current leakages. Though he came to us he hadn’t any idea of this 3D printing technology, eventually which we were able to help in crafting it, and later he sold it to an electrical company. The problem is; lots of people think that they need to come with the design for us to get it done which is not necessary, maybe we are not able to provide the solution with 3D printing, but we could provide with options which is available with new technology.
From a layman’s point…. Firstly, anyone in a company should research


7.	What are the job opportunities you offer to the public through 3Dprinting? What is your stand in the local job market?

We are very tough in this area, because we can’t hire a 2D designer and ask them to get something fabricated in 3D. So what we offer as jobs is, if someone comes as a designer, first, we first let them understand the complete process. We teach them designing and advanced designing, and also how to use the advanced machineries which usually you don’t have access to. Therefore, it is more of a learning environment we have here, with people who are interested in discovering and innovating.
Something interesting I need to mention is that, we have 90% women running press machines here. I challenged the mindset that this is a man driven industry, men are designers and men can make fabrications and women can’t do this.
Like that I always try to push people beyond the boundary to achieve things.

8.	For your industry, opportunities lie in many fields of the country, particularly in the health sector, how would you make use of these opportunities? 

This is a very sensitive area to look through. There are mainly two sectors we can look for; one is Invasive and the other is non- invasive.  Non-invasive is prosthetics, for example the things we create to aid damaged limbs like casting and we do this custom designed casting through 3D printing after scanning the damaged limbs. We create it so the patient is more comfortable wearing it. These can be specialized with features like air vents to prevent all those scratchy and uneasy feelings you get once you locked your limbs for months or weeks.
Currently, we don’t get prosthetics for some ages below and some ages above due to the complex processes it has to go through in making the right fit. 
But through 3D printing we can get it done too
Invasive is where we print internal organs with medical grade materials, not live organs (not yet) but the things like knee caps and bones which we haven’t tried through this technology, but definitely an area which we can look for research and development.
Another trending area is the exoskeleton industry which is something you wear as an extra spine which gives you superhuman capabilities to carry heavy packages easily, which is currently being used at places such as Amazon warehouses.



9.	What are the strengths you find in yourself, the concept and the company, as those that enabled you to achieve stability in terms of competition?

Definitely, it’s the people. For a company to be successful, it’s the people you have within the company is your strength. It’s the people who are sitting around the table with you who bring something new to the table every day, unique and creative or sometimes it might be crazy which doesn’t matter at all. So it’s a very interesting group of people, and one thing I always look for is the talent who can disrupt the technologies through their thinking.

10.	What is your idea about the potential of Sri Lankans to take on technical and innovative areas like this? 

Yes it is possible. One main thing to consider is a probable way to stop talent going out of our country or brain drain. 
In an economic point of view, if we look in to the main contributors for the GDP in our country like coconut, tea and rubber a very few technological developments have been done. Therefore, as Management and IT undergraduates these are the areas you can study to innovate.
If Sir Lanka wants to change, first to consider is to look at the things in different ways. This is impossible if the people at higher chairs are with the traditional mindsets.

11.	What are the pros and cons of being Sri Lankan for a concept like yours? Could it have been easier if you started this in a technologically advanced country and not in Sri Lanka?

Yes, it would have been much easier if I had started this business in a different country in terms of profits, facilities and other, but which inspired me to introduce this here is the patriotism I have for my country and to bring up the Sri Lankan talents into an international level.


12.	How do you think the country could benefit from industries like this for its development?

What people don’t understand is, 3D printing doesn’t have to be something like you design today and use it for the rest of the time. You should use 3D printing to explore a design and to check whether it can solve your problem. That is where laymen are having issues. 
This technology is meant for people to explore new design and try and fail. But, once you explore it you can do it in bulk in whichever the way you want, and you will have enough business. 

Interestingly, this is a technology which anyone can use it for. I can’t specifically say that this is only for this area. An individual or a company can use this for improvement or put your ideas into action.


13.	What advice would you give to a person who wishes to enter into this field of work?

The biggest issue I faced myself when I was young is, nobody came to me and spoke or showed me the paths which I can explore.
Though now that my personality is associated with innovation, I never studied about it or I have the skill set.  Therefore, my message for the exposition readers is;

You should always be willing to learn, ‘blue sky theory’; that is how some IT companies introduce this; which says to look at the things way beyond. So my message to everyone is take a minute take a step back, go hundred thousand feet above, and look at your situation first, and think how you can do something differently; better and faster. Always ask questions and never ever worry about being wrong.

1.     How does it feel to hold the title of the best woman entrepreneur of 2016?

I am honored and really happy that Sri Lanka, as a country, has started to focus and assist females to get into more leadership roles. I am really honored by the fact that I was given that title. It also made me feel that there’s a responsibility, because when you are given something it’s not like before; you are given something, to do something with it. This has given me much inspiration to go out there, be better and to make my company better.  To put it shortly, it helped me a lot.

2.	How would you describe the journey that led you to this position?

I would start by saying that I’m not even halfway through my journey yet; the point at which I am now, is almost like the start; of a new beginning. It took me a while to figure out what exactly I wanted to do. I was kind of lucky to have known that I wanted to work with computers or solutions; to begin with. Having already had my foundation, I didn’t have to look around too much. But now, in fact, I have found my way, I have found my place. I know what I’m capable of. We at IronOne, have 4 areas that are doing extremely well.
BoardPAC is a board automation solution that actually has the power and ability to be the best in the world. Currently, we are undisputedly the best in Asia as shown by many of our board meetings; in fact, large co-operations tend to work with us. I have a vision and a mission so to say. I have to say that, making BoardPAC be a global leader will automatically put Asia, Sri Lanka and its women, in the global forefront. We are on our way with that ambition; that is why I said that it’s a start of a massive global run, and    we are working towards achieving it. When you asked me what it was like to have been given the title, what I could put into perspective is the fact that- what you see is an award or an achievement, but, in actuality, an “achievement” precedes hundreds of failures, hundreds of challenges. Puzzlingly, we don’t publish failures in newspapers or anything, we publish our achievements only. As a matter of fact, we have to understand that, for anyone who has achieved anything; the bigger the achievement, the bigger the failures had been. So, whoever wants to achieve has to be ready to endure a lot of rejections, a lot of hardships, because one milestone or success actually comes after a series of very difficult activities. 
That is what it had been like for us, and I think we enjoyed it and thrived for it. As I always say, if something comes in our way and blocks us, we can choose to be blocked by it permanently or to make it temporary. We would need to try harder to get through that block and as we cross through to the other side, it would be very much less crowded as everyone else would be helped up by the block. That is what I constantly think of as I encounter situations of different dimensions.

3.	What are your future plans for IronOne?	

IronOne has 3 areas, and BoardPAC is definitely the one I wish keep working on. We have set a target to be the world’s best board automation solution within the next 3 years, starting from 2017. We will take it there with a huge market share. ATrad is another area which is an online soft trading product. Currently, we are the dominant player in Sri Lanka. To put it quantitatively, 80% of the soft trades that Colombo stock exchange carries out, comes through ATrad. So, since we are presently dominating the market, we are doing pretty well. We have decided to go overseas; Bombay stock exchange is being integrated now. In comparison, we have about 24 brokers whereas Bombay stock exchange has over 1000; so we will be quite busy, and that is just one out of the many markets we are looking at.
I will not go into further detailing about the other products as they too are in similar paths. So, essentially, what we found is that we are not going generic anymore, we are not going to do what other people are already doing. Instead, we are trying to find some special paths and everything we do is for global dominance. We are doing something for a huge impact, we are focusing on being something more than just another co-existing software solution. I think we are here to give some good fight internationally. So everything we are touching these days, is quite special.

4.	What do you think the core strength of IronOne from your point of view?

The core strength of IronOne is that we are a group of people who are quite passionate. Our tagline is think, innovate and lead. So starting from this, we are not doing standard stuff. We are looking at doing special things; impactful things. The whole team actually here is not for a job. I think we in fact tell them if you are going for a job, there are hundreds of companies to go and you can find a job. This is something special, if you want to be a part of this journey and create both Sri Lanka and Asia right on top, join with us.

5.	What is your view towards the employability in the Sri Lankan context?

Sri Lanka is a relatively a smaller country. India is right next to us with a population of one billion. I think that we have strengths. We are very analytical as companies who operate. Everywhere we go, the Sri Lankan is accepted much, and the Sri Lankan has acquired a very good name even within the companies in those countries.  Sri Lanka has kept this name in the international industry and we have a lot to talk about technologies. So our people have to look at specializing. I see the trends like driverless cars:  Standard coders, the bottom layer of software engineering will be automated. So if you are going for a driving job or come into a software, and if you just stay there for about 5 to 10 years, you will lose your job. So we have to specialize. I think we have the capability. In a sense, IronOne is in the products because again it’s innovation and specialty.  I really think we can make Sri Lanka as the country known for good products. Products don’t need thousands of people. They need only about 200 people and you can dominate the market. 

6.	How do you think that being a woman has helped you in growing yourself to the position you are now?

I must say being a woman has helped me because you know that female or woman entrepreneur or the female exporter of the year; there is no any male entrepreneur or something. The title actually has helped me. I am not saying that the titles do matter alone. But, titles certainly did help me because; in international markets they are given a very high value. Assume someone has an award; it helps to put them in the limelight. I must say the local awards that I got starting from the women’s chamber and then, the national chamber of exports, which I have got it for the second time, two again in a row. These actually helped me to get seen by the international community. I specifically say EY, where Ernst   & Young has a global a program. So it was very easy for Ernst and Young to locally nominate me for the global program and I was selected from Asia Pacific. we are doing pretty well during that time. That is helping me a lot with overseas marketing and many other things. 
Also being a woman has helped me in the respect. Because, when I started my company, I didn’t really think I am a woman or I am this or that, we just focused on the working stuff. But, when you look at this office, there is a minority of women. Perhaps because these sorts of software related work is mostly done by men. So when you are a woman, I think you can be seen very much. Because, you are among the minority. So, I used every opportunity that I can get advantage. That is the way I am looking at it.


7.	Would you like to share some of your biggest challenges in life on your way to the Best Woman Entrepreneur of 2016?

There were so many challenges. When I originally started quite a long time ago, I found it really difficult to figure out what I should do. I didn’t have a product to begin with, but I wanted to do something impactful. So we started off by offering services, but we were always on search for a potential product to develop a unique identity. Then, one by one the products came; at first, as requests from clients, and we found out that there are good solutions to sort out with a potential demand. So Atrad – Online Trading, came out as one of the first products. BoardPAC came in 2011, which is our best product for now. Further, there are others like Infosense which is a special kind of a BI platform. So, finding a product that is worthwhile, and building it was the biggest challenge.  That whole phase was quite difficult because you have to find the right people and enough money to proceed, and to pay the salaries of the employees. It was challenging because I had to grow organically without sponsor. So we had to do things on our own and pay for ourselves. Now we have come to a point where we have to scale. Like I said, market dominance is about the ability to sell millions of copies to so many people. After trying various things what I found was, at the beginning, we became successful because my employees; including myself were very good as individuals. But then, we have realized that we can’t massively grow by just that ourselves being good. So the next stage has come. We have to grow in order to achieve market dominance. That means that the team has to be amazingly brilliant. It’s not only about the Sri Lankan context. Now we already have overseas staff from over 7 countries. Finding the right people, growing them and coaching them is another different phase. So, that’s my challenge for the moment. It’s not about market conditions. The challenge is within us, to find our way.

8.	On a general context, what do you think is the main issue that has to be addressed with respect to the Sri Lankan Youth?

If I compare, when I consider myself as a youth, we had a hard time. Everything was difficult. So, we automatically became quite hard-working. So we are persistent and resilient. But, these days I feel that the youth has everything easily. Earlier our lives had to be planned and it was quite difficult. The youth now don’t get that training by default. It’s a thing that is missing. You all expect for quick results, which is not the real life is about. You have to wait, and you have to work on something for a longer period in order to achieve a good result. You have all the gadgets, but actually it’s a disadvantage, because you are not getting life training. I find that in the newer employees who join my organization. I am not saying all of them are likewise, but you have to show them that achieving something big means you have to be patient. The youth has to improve their overall attitude to be a perfectionist; excelling one’s self, being responsible, even small things like writing your letters without typing mistakes. It used to matter a lot to us when we were young. But then, for the youth nowadays, these are of little concern with the facilities such as texting and autocorrecting. These little things make a huge impact. Everybody, including the government, say that Sri Lanka is geographically located at a center of trade. I feel that the youth must take the advantage of this to connect with other Asian countries. Sri Lanka is too small, so we must actually take Asia as our map when we try to launch a product or a service. So, I would like the youth to see this opportunity to make benefits.

9.	How do you define yourself as a person?

I am a purpose-oriented person. A fine purpose is what wakes me up in the morning. It is what keeps me up awake. Only when I was trying to be impactful, I found a purpose. I found a vessel to make an impact for Sri Lanka, Asia and women as well. I am a person who is interested in doing things that is meaningful. It should be mentioned that right now, I am in the middle of the craziest ride along with everybody here. That’s me. After all, this is a game that we’re playing. It is a challenge that we have to face. So we play, we strive to do something. Let’s say our goal is to make the best couple of products in the world, and we would not be able to do it for some reason, but it is all fun for us because we try our best. So particularly, I’m not a person who take things too seriously or philosophically. I try to have some fun because we are here for a short time. Hence, do something good and leave.

10.	What is your idea on the current job market in the IT field?

I must say there’s a lot of potential in younger generations. Even when I go out there to speak with those people overseas, they prefer to know about Sri Lankan people’s abilities. There’s a huge market need for IT people for most of the companies when compared with other sectors in the industry. I would like to encourage people to get involved with jobs overseas as well because Sri Lankans have the potential to take up to that challenge. For example, compared to India and other countries, Sri Lanka has more potential to work with overseas customers. So, capacity is there. The job market should be good.

11.	What were your aspirations as a child?

Actually, I did not have any. I just wanted to finish off my secondary education at school. I thought the real life would begin after this whole school thing ends. In fact, I found mathematics and other certain subjects which were easy for me and interesting. So as a child, I didn’t imagine that I am going to do anything in particular. Frankly speaking, I was an introvert. I didn’t really want too much attention on me either. I am even surprised looking at myself now. Anyway, I always wanted to do something which was interesting. Unlike other children, I did not want to save the world. I have had no particular vision like that. I just wanted to enjoy the life.
After I completed my studies, I went to England. I worked at 2 companies back then, and came back to the homeland. When I was working at Lankabell, I came across software development, and I wanted to start something on my own to explore things.

12.	How hard/easy it has been to become a CEO at a company in a male dominant field?

Quite challengeable to be exact. But, the real challenge was to create something really valuable. Becoming a CEO was not quite difficult with all the authority followed with the position itself. But, making a company to be successful where I am a CEO was a tough journey. I don’t see myself on any gender specification. We come here and we just do it. Regardless the gender specification whoever fits in the job, gets on with the job. Tough decisions that I had to take when recruiting the accurate person for the perfect job was one of the main challenges I faced being the CEO of my company.  
We have thousands of clients as of now. Not a single opportunity was a bed full of roses. Specially, the first ones. Sometimes, it took us several years for a single project, but still we kept on going. Let me mention you one of the experiences I came across, once when I was in India and visited the Airtel, the secretary told me that, “You know Lakmini I have seen a lot of products and your competitor products. But when other people come, meet me and when I give them a challenge they don’t come back. But you always do. You always come back with a response.”  He appreciated that our products are better than that of our competitor’s.  Airtel is just an example. There are many other reputed companies which were really satisfied with the quality of the service and the products we offer in our company.

13.	Do you think that being a woman adds an additional risk factor for one to succeed in her career?

Socially what happens is women carry a lot of burden in terms of children and the social work. Their time is limited. But when it comes to me, I put a lot more effort on work rather than my personal life. Actually, I don’t have any kids of my own. If I had any, I don’t know whether if I could have this much of free time to concentrate on the work. Definitely, the society is changing; the men and the whole society are taking more ownership of family units. But, what happens traditionally is that women play a major role in such situations implicitly. In the meantime, you won’t be able to concentrate to do something very serious when you are within a time constraint. You can’t afford excuses like taking leaves for a kid’s sickness in an environment like this. Definitely, this can be a direct challenge for women. In my perspective, things like female awards and all are awarded in order to encourage women to draw their attention more towards the industry rather than being framed only within the family concept or domesticity. Actually, I am very lucky to say that as my family obligations are quite very low, it offers me the real freedom needed for my work to be balanced easily.
 
14.	How do you define your team “IronOne”, and what kind of qualities do you look into when recruiting someone?

Like I said earlier, our motto is “think, innovate, and lead”. Everyone who comes here is not for a job. We work like its life and death. That is the kind of work that we have here; team that we can rely on. Ability to rely on people is extremely important as much as talent. The word “team” is a broad concept where its culture lies as a network. We consider ourselves as a family. For me, the main criterion when recruiting a person is the attitude. It’s true that capability, talent, skills, personality and many more qualifications matter in order to fit in to a particular job. But if the attitude is there, all the other qualifications come around implicitly. To be more precise, it is the correct attitude, not the smartness or the talent that will survive in this field in the long run.

15.	What is the message that you can give to university students, and what is your view about the university education?

With a quick flashback to my university life, what I think I achieved mostly is to learn to give focus, and to stick to something for a certain period of time. Moreover, networking and working with other people as a university undergraduate helped me to improve all the social skills now I’ve gotten within myself. If I talk about the studies to be exact, I know for a fact that it is the same as of now with regard of being an undergraduate of a university. But for software engineers, may be a little less because, some of those coursework can be used now. Usually, we relearn everything when we come to the Industry. Mainly, the technological things. University education gives you the basics for you to stand up and walk towards the society whereas the real life gives you the experience in a much harder and a rougher way than that of a university. In the university, it is just a project for about maximum of one-year or so. But in the real scenario, it is your life we are talking about. I learnt that I can do anything; the confidence within myself in the university itself. My advice for university undergraduates like you is; engage in a lot of extracurricular activities and gain confidence. Because, after the graduation you will have only two options. That is to start your own company and become an employer or become an employee in someone else’s company. Actually for both, you need the confidence. In fact, I talked about the attitude previously. Part of it is the confidence. Even if the person is without any skills, if he is confident enough, he will learn the skills gradually and continue with his work easily.

1)	It is always important for a sportsman to occupy yourself in the moment. Let’s begin with that for a change. What do you think about your current way of life after your retirement?

Now I spend most of the time with my family. I really missed a lot of time with my family in the recent years. My family including my parents and my wife has sacrificed a lot on behalf of my career. In addition, I personally think that I have a lot to give back to my family. Therefore, overall, I enjoy my life now with my family as I have always wished.

2)	You have kept your mark high up in the international cricket arena as a well-known all-rounder. What do you think about your personal life in terms of all rounding? 

I am an all-rounder in my personal life as well. I engage in almost every kind of work at my house including our children’s work as well. We have a practice in our family to share our work and take our decisions as a family together. I think that is one of the main things that help our family in all our endeavors and makes it special.

We have four children and that does not make us feel any hassle in doing their work on our own. I, as a person, enjoy the company of my family to the fullest. I manage all my work and my businesses while contributing to all these works as well.  And most importantly, my children are taught to be independent and manage their work by themselves. So in general, my family is actually a team that works together for the betterment of each other and the family as a whole.

3)	Compared to your sports career your role as a businessperson is fairly less spoken among the public. Would you like to share some of your memories/ experiences as an entrepreneur?

I have always been interested in the hospitality sector. I think it is important to make the visitors feel welcomed and share our resources and values with them. I started a hotel in an old family house, which belonged to Mr. Wimalasurendra, the first engineer of the country. I even have kept a book about him for the visitors to refer; therefore, I have used every aspect of my business to add value to our country and the people in it.

I have taken my country to the world through cricket and it is my chance this time to use my entrepreneurial ventures to bring value to my motherland. I always share our cultural backgrounds and heritage with our guests. I think it is important for me to use my influences to enhance the image of the country. I think that we have not been yet been able to bring that value addition to our country through tourism. Additionally, I have chosen this field of hospitality and tourism since I can perform well in that arena with respect to all my contacts that I have around the world.

Recently, I have started my own Tea Business, which is also another way of promoting one of the most valuable assets of our country. There I have come up with a classic combination of Cricket with Tea. All my promotions and designs for the business are infused with the theme of Cricket. 

I have hopes of taking my tea business to the world as a global brand name while expanding my hotel business through opening up new hotels at main cities of tourist attraction like Sigiriya, Dambulla and many more. 

So, if I am to speak in general about my business ventures and the motives behind them, I would say that I always try to enhance the Sri Lankan value and recognition through the display of its valuable assets. Personally, I think that these things make me special among many other businesspersons that are associated with similar fields and areas.

Being an entrepreneur is really challenging and personally, I am very used to face those challenges at my best. Even as a cricketer, I had to face many challenges as an upcoming cricketer from a small rural school. I had a very humble family background as well. I faced many challenges. Those challenges have helped me to achieve a lot in my life as a cricketer and a public figure.

I think the best way to overcome a challenge is to look through it with courage. I have always had string determination in whatever I do, irrespective of it being a personal or a professional challenge. 

4)	What do you think about the status of a professional sportsman in a country like ours?

When comparing with the international standards, the level of professionalism in sports is relatively low in Sri Lanka. We Asians are known to be guided around almost everything we do. Usually, under the global professional standards, the individual players know their daily routines and tasks. 

I must say that, if one seeks to be professional sportsman, she/he has the potential to get the maximum out of their capabilities. Being a professional help you to be responsible of your own career. Doing things on the demands of another will not help a sportsman to succeed. I would rather mean more sense, when they take account of their own tasks and schedules. 

Professionalism in sports does not merely restrict into one’s behavior within the ground, but rather it is a broad subject, which extends from the meals to the fitness of a sportsman. We can improve our sports achievements, as a country if our Sri Lankan sportsmen can practice professionalism throughout their careers.

5)	How has cricket helped you to grow yourself into the brand you are?

Of course, everything that I have built up so far is a result of my cricket career. So, I think it is much more appropriate to say that I am the brand I am today, all thanks to my cricket career. Nevertheless, I would say that I am a different kind of a brand, when compared with the others. I had to make a lot of commitments and go through a lot of sacrifices to make my brand as a person. 

There were times when I walked around 4-5 km to school, so that I could save the money that my mother gave me. I saved money from a very little age to support myself in order to purchase cricket bats and balls. It is the same for my brand as well, where I had to do make a lot of sacrifices little by little, which ultimately got saved to build up my brand. That is why I said that my brand is different from others.

Building this brand did not happen overnight. Growing up, I did not get many opportunities to show my talent. However, I was determined to make the best out of the chances I got. I tried to show my talent in whatever the opportunity that came my way. I took risks as a sportsman and as an individual, where I made some critical decisions along the way. I changed my position as an opening batsman in the lineup in 2008, which was an uncertain decision to make, but it actually helped me a lot to improve my contribution to the team. Therefore, the success of my brand is closely associated with the risks that I took along the way. 



6)	Cricket is regarded as the “Sport of the gentlemen”.  What is your definition of being a true gentleman with respect to both the personal and professional lives? 

As I previously mentioned, cricket has taught me a lot throughout my journey as a cricketer. One of the most important things that I think a true gentleman would possess is the ability to accept the losses as much as the victories. Not just in cricket, it is something that I have witnessed a lot in this country as well. Most of the time, people cannot accept the challenges and the losses. Even in terms of education, we see how students completely give up their lives and even decide to take their lives for a mere downfall at an examination. It is good to have higher goals in life, but it does not mean that those goals are more worth than your own life. We should develop the growth mindset within ourselves. Losses should imply a change in the way you do things. 
One should know her or his own strengths and the path that should be taken in order to reach where you aim at. My father was a member of the national football team, so he always wanted to see me pursuing as a football player as well. I was the captain of the school football team as well. But, I was aware of my actual potential and my strengths. I am truly grateful for my parents for allowing me to pursue my own dreams. I think our next generation will be much more improved and advanced, if all the parents can provide that kind of freedom for their children to chase their own dream while guiding them the right way.

7)	It is one thing to excel at a sport, but keeping your trademark on an international platform is beyond elementary. Tell us about your story behind the legendary style “Dilscoop”. 

Paddlesweep is a very common style that the batsmen attempt on. Back in the 2009, at an IPL tournament when I was playing for the Delhi Dare Devils, I was thinking of a more innovative way to collect runs throughout the tournament. So, I thought of scoring above the wicket keeper, because that is a position, which does not have any fielders. I still remember how I played my first shot for an Australian bowler in that tournament, where Adam Gilchrist was the wicket keeper behind the stumps. As soon as I scored that point, Adam Gilchrist came to me and asked about that style. That kept me thinking about the power of such a shot, which could actually disrupt and exert pressure on the opposing fielders. After that, I did not play that shot throughout the tournament. Because I was thinking about the world cup which was in another 08 months’ time. I had the intensions of improving this style, so that this could be used as a powerful weapon for our team. 

After returning from the IPL in 2009, I practiced that style a lot with the rubber balls. I wanted to excel in that shot, in order to use it effectively at the world cup. I am glad that I was able to do a lot for my team from my style. We went on to become the runners-up of the tournament and I even became the man of the series and even got a style named after me. 

The commentators did not have a proper name for this shot. So the ICC had requested the cricket fans to suggest names for this shot. I can recall Mr. Nazar Hussain, the commentator of the final match, requesting me to select a name for this shot out of the top voted suggestions. There, I selected the name “Dilscoop” which is the very first time in the history of cricket, to have a shot name after a player. I do not think of it as a personal achievement, but rather as a victory for my country. 

Obviously, there were many accusations along the way by different parties for naming it after me while some even suggested different names to it. Even now there are instances, where the commentators do not use the name “Dilscoop” to describe it. Now, whenever I see the foreign players attempt “Dilscoop”, it gives me an absolute honor to have made a small country like ours stand high above in the world of cricket.

8)	Your performance as the man of the series in the T20 world cup 2009 is indeed a special milestone in your life. Looking back at your early stages as a growing cricketer and then as a master sportsman, what would you regards as your reason for success.

On very simple terms, I would say it’s the commitment and the passion that followed me in everything that I did. The year 2008 was the turning point of my life. I was very relaxed in my mind, which is one of the most important aspects for any cricketer, the freedom of mind. I must mention about the support that I received from my wife. She supported me in every aspect of my life. It is critical for anyone to have a support system for them. I was very fortunate to have such a string support from my family, which again is one of the main reasons for my success. 

Also, not to forget the times when I walked for practices every day for 4-5 kilometers. It was all about the commitment and the passion. I was very passionate towards becoming a cricketer, hence I committed to it. If I can reach this position with such humble beginnings, I think these young generations with a lot of facilities can make it to even higher. 

9)	How did you manage your time and efforts evenly to succeed in your personal and professional lives?

Currently, I am more focused on my professional life. I think it is important to know your priorities, in order to manage your time. Presently my focus is my family whereas the other commitments take a second place. Managing time is critical for a person like me. In fact, I handle a lot of social service programmes, which requires considerable amount of time and effort. Therefore, I plan my time accordingly, with respect to the commitments I have to make. 

10)	How do you maintain your brand and personal image even after your retirement from the international cricket career?

I think my brand is what I did throughout that past years as a cricketer. I always advice the upcoming cricketers to give their best and do something valuable to this field and make a good name for themselves before they retire. By far around 200 cricketers have displayed their talents but only a few of such names remain in the minds of the people. You have to do something memorable for your country. 
Things like Dilscoop and my other commitments to my country has been there in the minds of the people for a very long time. They have it in their hearts. I decided to retire at a time when I was ranked as the Number one all-around player in the world. I left at a time when people asked me to not to. However, I took a decision upon my understanding. It is important that you take your leave at the right time rather than waiting till the others ask you to leave. If you overstay your limits, it will only make your efforts go undervalued at the end. I think specially for me, my Dilscoop took my own brand to a different level. So hopefully, due to all my achievements and my commitments, I think my brand and my name will be there in the history of cricket for a much longer time. 

11)	What do you think is your key quality that made you stand out among others?

I think it is the fact that I still remember and respect my humble beginnings, which makes me want to live a very ordinary life even now. No matter what I have achieved, I like to be a very ordinary person, who lives with everybody in a very gracious manner. Honestly, I still prefer travelling by bus or by a three wheeler occasionally. I still do that even when others ask me to not to. I treat everybody in a similar cordial manner, and I do not divide people by their status or the wealth. My mind becomes so free and tranquil, when I live such a simple life, as any regular individual. So all in all, I think my sociable and forthcoming nature makes me stand out among the others. 

12)	How have your experiences in the field of cricket, helped you to transition into the business world? 

Cricket and business are two different fields in terms of its execution. Cricket is a sport, which has its own set of ways while the businesses carry their own. But, one of the most important things that I gained from cricket is the exposure and the gift of meeting different friends. In fact, those connections have been very important to me throughout my career as a cricketer and as a businessman. 

My network of friends and colleagues has helped me a lot in terms of my businesses as well. As I previously told my businesses are mainly focused on out Sri Lankan heritage, which I was able to achieve with respect to the people that I associate with.
 
13)	Can you mention one quality that you think is vital for the Sri Lankan youth to harvest in them?

Anybody who dreams to succeed, needs to have an undying passion towards whatever they are doing. We all see how the modern youth is persuaded to do different things, which I think is not a good factor in the long run. Everyone should have the fair chance of doing what they aspire to do. A fifteen or a sixteen-year-old can understand what she or he should do with their life. In fact, they even have the ability to define their goals and the paths they would take in the future. 

So, the most important thing that I would like to highlight for the youth is that, they have to define their own goals and work passionately to achieve whatever the target that they set upon. Sometimes you might not succeed, but it is always better to have the underlying feeling of hard work, than the pure feeling of guilt. At the end of the day, they can at least rest well with the feeling of knowing that they everything that was there to do by giving their one hundred percent concentration and effort. 

14)	It takes more than talent for someone to reach the peak in a very competitive sport like cricket. How did you handle the pressure and this struggle on your way up?

I think my ability to withstand in stressful conditions is one of the key qualities that I have practiced from my childhood. I had so many challenges with respect to my family background. As the eldest in the family, I had a lot of pressure. I had many responsibilities to shoulder. 

As I grew up, I developed this quality as a person as well as a cricketer. Even as a cricketer, it is something that you have to practice gradually. It is hard for a newcomer to stand in this pressure in the beginning, but as we grow, we learn to adapt. I think it is the same situation in any field. Our first day in the job is also the same; we learn to handle the pressure as we gather experience. Even if you are an expert in a particular field, it takes about a month to fit yourself in. If one is confident in oneself, that person can work under pressure irrespective of the consequences.

The management of any company or an organization is trying to gain the maximum from the employees; this will anyway exert a pressure on the individuals irrespective of their backgrounds. We should know how to handle these pressures in our own ways.

15)	Being the captain in the Sri Lankan cricket team is far from easy. What do you think are your greatest strengths in serving your position well as a leader? What do you think about the importance of the leader-team combination to make a successful outcome?

I learned a lot during my time as a captain. A captain holds a lot of responsibilities than a member of the team. A leader should hold the responsibility of the team’s actions. I was direct in my decisions as a captain, which actually was a strength, which helped me a lot in succeeding at what I did. There were times when I gave my position as an opening batsman to a newcomer and fitted myself to a different position. Not to forget that I had kept some of my senior players out of the team while providing the chances to the newcomers. 

It is the same for any corporate situation as well. Being a leader comes with a whole another set of responsibilities, where you have to take account for your team’s actions, irrespective of them being successful or failures. I always explained out my reasons very clearly, which implied others that I took my decisions very decisively and directly.

Also, not to forget the experiences that I gained while playing under different captains. I had observed how they took their decisions and led  team. They were very different from one another. Therefore, I took them as different experiences while performing as a captain. So I think, the most important aspect for any captain, is, the strength to face and overcome the challenges that come in their way.

16)	What do you think about the importance of entrepreneurship to Sri Lanka?

I am very new to this. Though I have been engaged in cricket for almost 30 years, I am still a fresh businessman. I have understood my potentials and also the importance of recruiting the right people for the right positions. I have greatly used my experiences as a captain, when recruiting and delegating the work with my staff. Of course, I lead my businesses as the owner, but I have given my fullest support and trust towards these people who are much more experienced than myself in terms of their business backgrounds. 
As I have repeatedly said, my main focus is to add value to my country and its resources. Other than that, I have not thought much broadly on this topic of business. I have a lot more to learn about this subject. I think I will need another 4-5 years to make my place in the world of business. 
Just like cricket, one should have an ultimate goal, as a businessman. Business is not something that you can start out of the blue. You should have a target and a plan in order to succeed. It is important to have both short and long term goals in mind. What most of the people do is, they start and let the business running its own way, rather than looking at its future. 
The government should also provide the support to these businesses and the entrepreneurs. The support of the government is a vital factor for a business to expand beyond the local dimensions. I personally know that there is a considerable gap, in terms of government support. Now we see a lot of foreigners expanding their businesses in Sri Lanka and also the talented youth from our country migrating to foreign countries that value and take the maximum out of their potential. Therefore, the government support is critical for these young entrepreneurs and the startups. That way we can take our resources and assets to the world out there. That is my dream as well. I hope that the government would support these ventures in order to take our country to the level of success that we have benefitted from in the past.
