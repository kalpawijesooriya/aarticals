1.How do you define Chandani Bandara as a person and as an entrepreneur?

Actually I’m Chandani Bandara. I’m a very good entrepreneur and I’m not
Money minded. I always think about others’ happiness and their economy as well as my economy. At my workplace my carrier is more towards a mother than an entrepreneur.

2.	Did you always aspire to be an entrepreneur? What paved your way into it? What do you think is the turning point of your life?
Yes. 

From my childhood onwards I had the desire to be an entrepreneur and a leader one day. I’m the youngest of my family; for fun, all of my elder brothers and sisters bullied me. Because of that the desire of being a leader to all of them was implanted on my mind. I’m a quite radical character in my family. My thoughts were quite different from others. That’s why even from my little age, I had the dream to provide jobs to others.
When I was reading to my bachelor’s degree in Natural Sciences, in Canada, as for my part-time job, I was a cleaner at a salon. There I was inspired to select this profession, which paved the way into succeeding in this carrier.
So afterwards, I suddenly resigned from my job and started this journey with a small salon. I believe that as the turning point my life.

3.	What is the portfolio under the brand “Chandani Bandara”? Tell us about your venture.

We have many sections under our portfolio. “Chandani Bandara” Salon, Chalmway Academy, Forever Skin Natural Factory and under foreign businesses we have 2 Salons.

4.	What challenges did you face when initiating your brands and how did you overcome them? What were your strengths and barriers?

As a beautician, initially acquiring the recognition by the local customers was a challenge for me. At that time this field was not very much popular. There were only few well known beauticians in the country. So, reaching to that position was a big deal. But gladly the “Sirikatha” Newspaper made me popular overnight. But, I have to emphasize this; actually that time I had a simple knowledge about this field. But with that simplicity, I put my full effort for the completion of every task. So, people embraced me with their hearts.
Next Challenge was the foreign brands. When initiating FOREVER brand, that challenge was huge. Not only that, the flank attacks from the competitors also influenced a lot. But I believe I have a powerful strength and I do face them successfully.

5.	Criticisms are common in any field of irrespective of the differences. How do you handle the criticisms tossed at you?

I like to be criticized. Actually, criticisms can carry two things. Short termly, it may hurt you but, long termly it strengthens you. I learn from criticisms. I correct my mistakes from them. I have excelled my talents from them. Even the quality products of our brand are results and researches of the criticisms given by my customers. Criticisms carry lots of energy to life. So criticisms are really good for me.

6.	Your brand clearly stands out from other brands in the market. What do you think sets you apart from other similar brands?

Our products are real herbal, real natural genuine products. That’s the main reason to stand out from others.

7.	You say your biggest competition is from foreign brands that are marketed inside the country. Why do you emphasize that?

I believe that I don’t have any competition locally. I do respect all of them. But, the imported brands seem to be the biggest competition because of the mythical belief of good quality in imported products than local products in the mindsets of local customers.

8.	Beauty care is a field which is very crucial in customer satisfaction, so how do you maintain your market share under such conditions?

We only use FOREVER beauty care products for our customers in the salons. But if the customers insist on using different product rather than FOREVER brand, we gladly supply that service for them, so that our customers would be satisfied with what they get. The thing is, usually our customers prefer herbal, quality products and the reason why they are always with us is that our main focus is on herbal, pure natural products. We promote our product and try to increase market share by that. We also have other promoting methods like Buy one - Get one free, targeting that the customers would do a second purchase, hoping an increment in our market share while doing so.

9.	You always point out the importance of the recognition of beauticians as a major group of entrepreneurs in the country with which we agree. What is your take on that?

A beautician himself is an entrepreneur. That is actually undebatable. No matter the beauticians are rich or poor, they can be entrepreneurs in their own ways. They may have a crew behind them with whom they proceed further with the products and workings. What I believe is that a beautician is the best entrepreneur who doesn’t become a burden to the society and they are the people who bring out the beauty within people and earn their livings in a very humble manner.

10.	You have diversified into many areas in this industry. Starting an academy deals with a different need in the society. What was your intention behind this?

When I first tried becoming a beautician I did not have a proper place to learn the tactics and the strategies. I went to several places in order to learn, but it was all useless. When people enter a university, the environment for the undergraduates become totally different. They tend to learn more, with good quality levels with a better environment there. So I wanted to create the same environment for those who are willing to contribute for the beauty care field too. I wanted to let them practice the methods practically so that they would have better experience with that and so, one day the dropouts would be armored with expert quality in the field.

11.	What approach did you take to enter the European Market? How did you differentiate?

When I started the interview with you, I mentioned that our product basis is real herbal and pure natural. That’s the main difference between our products and European beauty care products. Most of the International products do promotions without specifically targeting a proper theme on beauty care field. But our intention is majorly on promoting herbal basis product promotions. We use herbal concept rather more specifically. Now the world is trending towards the herbal products and so it’s actually better for our own products. And I believe we are at the correct position of the competing road ahead in the European Market. But unfortunately in Sri Lanka it’s the opposite.

12.	How do you feel about the competition for your own brand in International Market?

Yes of course, it’s really good and definitely we are on the right track.

13.	You provide employment to so many Sri Lankans. And you take measures to uplift the personal lives in contrast to many other entrepreneurs in the country. How would you encourage other entrepreneurs to have a similar vision?

I’ll provide an answer for this question with an example. When concentrating on herbal based products turmeric seed has a very rich property which most people aren’t aware of. We go to farmers and buy the turmeric seeds where gradually those farmers themselves become entrepreneurs. Now many employees are working under those farmers and so they have improved their businesses. It’s the same with the farmers who cultivate Aloe Vera for our products. So this is how we encourage people to become entrepreneurs.

14.	According to your own point of view, what makes you stand out as a leader among the others?

Let me take you back to my childhood to answer that question for you. As I mentioned earlier, I was the youngest of my very big family, so I was always bullied by my elder sisters and brothers. That was the first time which stroke my mind to be a leader. Many people who call themselves as leaders were followers beforehand. But, what I did was, I created my own path with all the experience I had got. I had to handle 150 labors at first all alone as a leader. As I understood as a leader was that what those people needed most importantly was love and caring, which I simply gave them with my whole heart. They are really trustworthy people and most of them still work under me with the due respect for me. If full time workers are unable to work any further, I give them with another option as part time workers where I get the total workforce in return which makes me satisfied as well. I have a smile on my face when I come early in the morning to work and I greet them with a “Good Morning” which I know in return spirit up the young workers early in the morning.


15.	Do you think being a woman made it hard for you to succeed in the business?(How did you overcome them?)

Being a woman in this field actually provides me with lots of pros and cons. There is a lot of respect for a woman in the society, whereas women are easily offensive, sensitive type human characters as well. I am really very proud to be a woman. Even my husband works as the CEO for my company where I am the chairperson and many other men works under me in the company making me so proud myself. Many problems arise while working, that’s true. But, I being a woman face them with a brave heart, without easily getting down emotionally. Also when there is a chance, I grasp it very tightly where it profits me. So I believe generally being a woman is being lucky.

16.	What are the current constraints for female entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka? Why?

 My advice is don’t listen to any of them. If somebody restricts me of something, what I usually do is rather do the opposite of what they say. I really am a total stubborn character.

17.	How important it is to have a support system as a women entrepreneur?

For a woman the family support is more than anything. Luckily I have a well-educated husband and a family which paved this way for my success. My next gratitude goes to my staff. To balance the life and to reach to the desired position, that support system always must be there.

18.	What advices do you have for Sri Lankan young entrepreneurs who are willing to enter into local and international product market?

You should be honest. That’s the most important thing. You should look in to the lives of the successful entrepreneurs, identify the specificities, study them and develop them within you. You should develop your personality too. You should always be with clear aims. You should grab the skills and values which you need to be succeeded in your aim while travelling in this journey.

19.	What are your future plans for the expansion of your portfolio?

Now I’m planning to open a factory in Australia and to provide jobs for Sri Lankans. I’m thinking about the export industry too. On the other hand, I’m thinking about the production of good quality pharmaceuticals in Sri Lanka.

20.	You are a professional beautician, a teacher, an entrepreneur, a chairperson and a mother. If someone wants to think about you as a role model and develop their characters, what are your advices for them?

You have to have many experiences. Bad people means good experiences. You have to educate yourself for your dream. Trust others carefully, keep personal things to yourself only. First decide your ultimate goals, work hard for it and never make excuses. If you fall it’s done. So toughen your mind, never ever loose opportunities and anyhow achieve your targets. Do good. Be with your religion .Look after your family and the staff. Enjoy this short life. Past is past. Forget it. Think about today’s matters today. Think about tomorrow’s matters tomorrow. Balance your life. Your limitless courage and effort will pave the way for your success definitely.

      1.	Attune is a professional global consultant, how would you introduce your business and its activities? 
      
If you look at Attune, we are a global SAP solution provider. We are exclusively focused on fashion and life style base. We don’t work in any other industry. It’s purely this base that we operate. Our scope of services goes across retail companies, brand owners and manufacturing companies like MAS. We provide services across the entire value chain in the industry.
We are in 11 countries and we’ve been operating for the last 12 years under the name “Attune”. We began our journey back in 1999 as being a part of MAS internal SAP team. Subsequently, we became an independent company back in 2002 under the name of Rapian. In 2006 we established Attune as a joint venture between 3 other partners. We continued as Attune over the last 11 years. Over the years we’ve been extremely fortunate to have worked with the biggest brands in the market. Starting from Adidas, Burberry, Timberland, Crocs, Rockport, Columbia, and Brioni. We’ve been very fortunate to have been worked with most of the fashion brands in the world. 

2.	This industry is dynamic and diverse. It demands a broad scope of knowledge about many areas. How do you handle this scope as the Chief Operating Officer (of attune)? 

If you take our focus, being in the fashion industry as well our focus on being a SAP solution provider, those are the two main areas we really need to help our teams to be successful. As a boutique organization our customers expect our team members to come in, help, guide them, advise them and support them in making the right decisions in SAP implementation. We have to be a trusted adviser. That’s the key differentiate we have among any other solution provider in this base. In order to do that, our focus on investment is in our people. We actually started this process way before someone even joins Attune. We work closely with universities to develop curriculums. We participate in conducting educational programs. All with the idea of creating awareness and giving people a set of tools, irrespective of whether they join Attune or not, to be able to understand at least what SAP offers and what career development opportunities are there within that space. Then subsequently, we look at how we can attract and bring the best talents into Attune. Unlike most of the companies, we invest a lot of time to develop those capabilities, both in terms of their knowledge in SAP as well as giving them the right exposure, experience in the industry because for us since we focus only on fashion and life style, our consultancy cannot only on SAP consultancy. They have to understand the business process, industry, they have to be able to add value to our customers. I think that’s where we differentiate some of the other service providers. We start off our process when someone joins Attune by assigning them a coach. They spend 6 months initially, undergoing a training program. We have a very detailed process identifying the area where they need to invest in developing by monthly quarterly checking with those trainees. Initially we give them the right tools and exposure within Attune Sri Lanka to gain the first set of knowledge required to be a consultant. SAP product knowledge, industry trainings, take them to factories like MAS. Help give them the right foundation to build their career on. We invest a lot of time here giving them an opportunity to work with our global customers in support may be doing projects from Sri Lanka, then customers in the region, and finally work with customers globally. This is a good experience for those who have an interest to develop their careers in SAP. We have lot of folks who started off their careers from universities in Sri Lanka and developed their skills here and working with all our global brands in US and Europe.

3.	Could you elaborate on your business portfolio, your partners and specify the services and solutions you offer to the market?

We focus on fashion and lifestyle. It covers bit of a broad spectrum. But essentially it’s whatever touches head to toe. What we actually cover is, the companies that are into apparel, even sunglasses, bags, shoes, accessories. Even though it’s a niche, it’s quite a broad area. In terms of our client list, again it’s quite broad. We work with high fashion companies like Burberry and Brioni, sports and life style companies like Adidas and Columbia, footwear companies like Rockport and Crocs. 
Primarily what we offer is SAP solutions, but at the same time we offer complementary digital solutions where we provide development of those solutions using mobile and web technologies, java.net etc. Sometimes there could be a need that we can’t fulfill using SAP. There could be a need for some peripheral solutions which is easily accessible by the user. Companies wanting to touch end consumers. There are also requirements where companies want to go back in the supply chain and touch manufacturing companies and supply chain as well. In those area what we found is there is a lot we can do in using development technologies to build more customized purpose-built solutions to address some of their requirements. So in terms of products it’s SAP and other development technologies. In terms of services, we are an end-to-end service provider. We are starting with advisory services for the customers. We provide project management and implementation services. We provide manage services which is a post implementation we can maintain and manage the entire system; both SAP and non-SAP applications from operations here in Sri Lanka and in India. We also provide custom development as well. So broadly it’s those 4 pillars. We also provide business transformation and change management services as well. So if you look at most SAP implementations, it also requires the company to change their business process. So it’s not only changing a system. It’s something that requires a lot of attention in order to make an implementation successful. If the business is not ready to adopt these changes coming in, or if the users are not aware of how their works going to change after the new changes come in, it can make a lot of changes for a company. So we also provide business transformation and change management services to help them to move into a new system by helping them to identify the impacts of the new solution and how to work in the new environment and all of those areas as well.

4.	What do you identify as reasons for your specialization in the fashion industry? 

There are a couple of reasons. First we born out of the industry. MAS being our parent company we saw how MAS was extremely successful by being a niche player. At that time, they were focusing on intimate apparel. They were able to create a specialization that made them the leader in that area. So, we thought without being a generalist and trying to cover multiple different types of industries, why you don’t focus on, at that time, apparel and footwear. It really built some skill that differentiated us from other service provider. At the end you go to the market and say “I can do everything”, you can’t differentiate your services or you can’t showcase the value you can bring into a project or to a customer. If you look at our position in the market, we compete with the last 5 consulting firms at this time. Where we create differentiation is, make the product is number one. We’re specialized. We know the industry. We know how to add value. Guild you and help you make the right decisions in terms of the implementation. At the end of the day it’s paid off. It helped us create a good name in the market.

5.	 With the high cost, you only can target the large brands. Do you have any other options for small companies?
I think it’s evolving. In past, it was mostly the larger companies that embarked on a SAP implementation. Now you see a lot more companies in that SME also implementing. But, we believe that there’s a certain threshold point. If you are a startup and a certain revenue point, you may not have the maturity required to streamline your processes irrespective of SAP or any system. At the end when you hit a certain growth point you need to have a strong platform. Otherwise you can’t scale, you can’t go into new geographies/ product categories, you can’t acquire new businesses. That’s where products like SAP come in. It’s an extremely strong platform. They have a good place where you can start building your foundation and adding more building blocks on top of it. 
In answering your question, “no we don’t work with any other solutions”. But what we have specifically for the small and medium segment is, that we have developed, based on our years of experience, pre-confidence solutions. Usually what happens is, we work really close with the customer. We try to understand what their main areas are and based on our experience we help to find them solutions. What we also have built the solutions that can fit 70-80% of a business requirement, based on our years of experience. What it does is, it drastically decreases the time that you need to implement it. Thus, it will reduce your investment cost. That’s how we support the small to medium segments.

6.	What types of technologies do you implement?

Like I mentioned before, on the digital and custom development side we have capability around mobile development technologies, iOS, android, web development technologies, we have .NET, java. We have all of that. What we believe is giving the right solutions based on what the customer requires. Most of the times customer expects us to advise them because of our experience. We have fortunately built some credibility around there, to even to suggest the right technology to use, based on what they want to achieve.

7.	Using what metrics, do you measure the progress of the company?

Any organization has financial sort of metrics to measure how successful you are. At the end of the day, for any business to be successful and to achieve their objectives you need your customers to be successful and, in order to your customers to be successful, your people need to be successful in doing what they supposed to be doing and adding a value. We spend a lot of time focusing on how to make our team and our people successful. What we need to do is, equip them with the right skills, competencies, experience, exposure to be able to be successful and that helps our customers to be successful. Those are interrelated. HR teams along with services, teams spend lot of time in identifying the areas to help people grow. We have carrier coach program internally, where every person is assigned a coach. There’re periodical check-ins one a quarter. The responsibility of the coaches is to make their coaches successful. 

8.	 “Fashion” is global and diverse in terms culture and the likeness. Your organizational culture should suit these attributes to be successful. What is your take on this?

Attune as an organization, being a service provider, all are consultants who understand the nature of our business. And the fact that you need to be able to work in different environments. For an example, if you go to a company like Burberry, their attire would be different. They have a different expectation in terms of how you present the service at the workplace. Saying that, those are easier things to address. But at the end of the day, both the customer and the service provider know that there are some cultural differences. We, as Attune, make sure that we respect those cultural differences. We’re very fortunate to work almost in 11 countries which gives us a very diverse set of people working within Attune. We have almost 11, 12 nationalities within the organization. Being within that cultural diversity has helped us work better in different environments. Saying that though, I think Attune or any service provider, we set that expectation within our organizations. And we make sure that we try our best to see what indicates well and that always a very proactive set of activities we do; when you bring two teams together there are team building activities that we start on projects to make sure that people understand the working models, how to work within that team structure, customer expectations and work well.
I think we’re blessed with having this diversity. At the same time, we have a very unique culture within Attune. Attune as an organization is very flat. Titles don’t carry as much weight as credibility. People at every level are hands on. All though we are globally dispersed, we work as one team. We have an understanding of regional work ethics as well.

9.	What sort of opportunities are available for graduates? What is your stand in the job market?

We have a broad spectrum. What we really look for is the right attitude, aptitude, being able to initiate things on their own and we look outside of the pure academics as well in terms of your ability to be a team player. Only that will help us understand how successful you’d be, not only within Attune, but also in our customer environments. In terms of all the other areas such as technical skills and softs skills, we can actually help to develop them. That’s something that we do quite a bit. We have lot of training in terms of technical skills, soft skills, presentation skills, communication skills etc. to develop a person’s profile. But, unless they have the initial building blocks and the attitude to be self-motivated, then it’s a bit difficult. So, we are looking for those qualities.

      1)	According to your perspective, who is Mr. Pulasthi Wanniarachchi?
      
Pulasthi Wanniarachchi, according to some, is an SEO Engineer, and the others, a Digital Marketing Consultant. However, according to my perspective, a human being who is involved in digital work. 

2)	Apart from the qualifications you have obtained, have you felt like you needed to develop your skills further at any point of your career? If so, what were the challenges you faced while developing them?

Yes. A SEO Engineer, requires to learn   theories about and practice things on webs and the like. But, to keep up with current trends, you have to know   more about SEO sections, how to do digital marketing, so on and so forth; it’s a continuous process of   refreshing knowledge, as I see it. The theories that are applicable today, expire tomorrow. So, you have to “google things” to learn more, “do experiments” as demanded by your career, to keep up. If you can’t move with new knowledge and gather those; you can’t move with digital marketing and web marketing technologies.

3) What were the inspirations that guided you to where you are today?

For me, “Inspiration” is self-motivation, self-learning and the related. When I stepped into the industry as an SEO engineer, there were only a few people in Sri Lanka who knew the area and practiced as SEOs. So, I had no option but to self-learn. As I’m always self-motivated; I didn’t need anyone to back me up or guide me. I referred online tutorials etc. and gained awareness about the digital culture and knowledge- online, continuously and by myself, which eventually paid off.

4) Did you target at being an SEO engineer from the very outset of your career? 
If not, what led you to take the path you did?

SEO is a new trend for the Sri Lankan culture, though it had been introduced to and prevalent in the world since twenty or twenty-five years. In fact, even the internet has used it. But, after my A/Ls and my degree, I think it took around six years for me to learn about these and practice online. To lay it precisely, I didn’t have a dream of becoming an SEO engineer in my childhood; even though I loved to work with computers and all, I never dreamt of becoming an SEO engineer or a Software engineer. 
5) SEO has been the ultimate buzzword in the field of IT; evolving swiftly, yet the application of SEO remains challenging but also, unique. In your point of view, why is the task of an SEO engineer important in the current context?
In my opinion, it could be simply viewed as, “without an SEO, there is no point of having a website”; because, first of all, you need to know what the website is to be, how to create a website for your product or service. So, without knowing these things, there is no point of having a website. First of all, you have to know the needful points; what you must publish in your website, before the creation begins. For that, in my perspective, you need to have five pairs of eyes; those of a Designer, a Developer, a Content Writer and an SEO Engineer as well as those of a Network Engineer. The purpose of a network engineer, being the provision of security as there are many hackers in the present digital world; as much as those who hack around sixty thousand websites per day. So, you have to have security as well. After building your website, you need to have an SEO Engineer or a Digital Marketer; the latter because SEO stands only for “Search Engine Optimization” whereas “digital marketing” entitles Search Engine Optimization, Search Engine Marketing and Social Media Marketing. In the  current world where many social media platforms are available, it is important that you have a skilled SEO engineer or a digital marketer, when you wish to market your product or service; this will help you to go online and present your website to the target audience, get more visitors and leads for your product or service.

6) In your opinion, what are the current trends in SEO? What does the future hold for it? Other than the existing fields, what avenues, do you think, are available for SEO engineering to expand into?

Through the year 2017, SEO saw trends like, the need to have quality content and the need for content to be unique. This is particularly because uniqueness and quality play a crucial role in determining google ranks and because google doesn’t allow anyone to duplicate anyone else’s work; using blogs that review and capture content that are copied from another site and notifies you, through google webmaster. So, those  come first, then comes the mobile optimization part; nowadays many people use mobile phones, smart phones, tabs and many such devices, it is needed to optimize websites to suit the mobile world, or make them “responsive websites”. Responsive” means, you can simply view the website in laptops, tabs and other mobile devices. Then, for visual optimization, they have introduced Infographics and Image Optimization which are new concepts to Sri Lanka, in contrast to other developed countries. So, you must practice these when you develop websites. For example, making YouTube videos or small types of clips or other product or service based clips, appear on YouTube and also in other video channels could make your product or service market massive and wide.
You also must have an “eye catchy”, user-friendly website. Without fulfilling primary requirements like those, there would be no point in having an SEO Engineer or in getting the SEO stuff done. If you have a dull looking website without having proper images or a user-friendly environment, people may visit, but leave your website immediately. In the Current context of things, CEOs decide whether or not to buy your product in a matter of seconds by viewing your website. These are the main trends in 2017.

7) Taking a quantum leap, you came up with your own personal brand ‘SEO Pula’, last year. What was your idea when you started this? Tell us about the beginning.

When I left my previous company, I thought of having my own digital marketing consulting firm to serve Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan business community through the things I had learned and the experience I had gained to help the digital era of Sri Lanka. That’s what I’m still thinking about. I could work in a free environment and do new experiments for the present generation while conducting good awareness programs through Digital Marketing in Sri Lanka. That’s why I decided to build a firm like “SEO Pula”.

8) Where do you see” SEO Pula” in the future?

My target is to build awareness and to build a proper digital marketing organization in Sri Lanka, to build and serve the country and help the business community appear on the internet and digital platforms and grow their businesses through those.

9) SEO is a new concept to Sri Lanka. Are there sources through which an interested individual could learn about it or obtain a related qualification from? What are the possible paths to enter into this field? 

At present, there are institutions that offer courses on digital marketing and similar subjects. When I started, there wasn’t any place to go to, to learn these things. Now private institutes as well as government institutes offer a subject called “E Business”, through which they try to give knowledge about this area to students who are willing to learn. But, if you aspire to become an SEO Engineer, you should have self-motivation and self-learning skills within you, added to the ability to work continuously. Otherwise you can’t achieve great things. You will have to know the product/service well and how to market it online. You may know all the theories, but when you go to the market and apply those theories only, will you be faced with problems. Because the final outcome lies in practically applying the theory to a product or service. Otherwise it can’t acquire a massive, eye catchy market; the best thing to do is to work on it and do so- continuously. Otherwise you can’t achieve goals in this area. It is accurate to say that your inner self should be self-motivated, working continuously and self-learning, if you are to achieve big goals in this area.

10) What are the current opportunities for SEO Engineering in Sri Lanka?

The number of opportunities are increasing because Blue Chip Companies and other companies in travel & hotel trades, financial businesses, news and media are looking for people who know about digital marketing and SEO; because they  have digital culture in-house and need to promote themselves in the current world through websites and social media. So, if you are a person who knows these things you have good opportunities in many such areas and more; even in job websites you could see more vacancies and a higher demand for social media marketers, social media executives as well as SEO Engineers and Digital Marketing Managers. Knowing this is good to brand yourself too.

11) What are the areas SEO Engineering has a chance to expand into, in Sri Lanka?

Many companies are expanding their products with which, “the need to promote” increases. Marketing trends are such that; people wish to save time; they don’t want to go to a boutique or to a shop or a supermarket to buy things, they love to sit in front of a computer and purchase the products they need. So, if you have an SEO Engineer for your product or service, he/she will make the product and show the product to the customer who is looking for the product or service. Even small business will have big opportunities through this digital marketing culture.

12) What are the differences you see when you compare yourself with the present young generation? What is the advice you could give them? 

The present young generation has grown up with social media, they seem to want to know and show their events and everything on social media, individually and in groups. My advice to the youngsters is, do your level best by trying to learn more about which ever the area you are studying and apply the knowledge to benefit yourself as well as the country. You may wish to leave this country and go to a better place, but, before that, do something for your country from your knowledge and give something back to the country. For you, it will be a source of self-satisfaction. That’s what I wish to ask from the young crowd.

13) You have started a new career path with your own organization. What are the challenges you had to face when you started the organization?

Yes, when you start a new organization or a firm, you will face many challenges like acquiring a new market and having trusted clients and all. You may meet good people along with a few who are bad. You will have to know how to manage those people and market yourself. You need to be honest while you are doing the job. You can’t misguide your clients; everything will be visible online. So, what we do is; building good relationships with customers, giving a good service, parallel to support services. It doesn’t matter if you are at home or at a party; it doesn’t matter if you do SEO or Digital Marketing, if you have a device with you, you can do it- from anywhere, anytime. So the best thing is to be loyal to your customer and to show   the best result to him or her.

      1)Share us your background on the inception of “Arimac” and the vision behind it.
      
We started Arimac in 2011 with the vision of being the geniuses of digital interactive media. We wanted to create a unified platform for technophiles and creative researchers who wish to come on board and play in different digital innovations. 

2)How did you come up with the term “Arimac” and how was the team “arimac” formed?

The term ‘Arimac’ is the reversed spellings of my first name ‘Chamira’ with the omitted ‘h’. However, now we have a team of 55 members working with us. All the members are from various backgrounds. We have engineers as well as creative designers working with us. So it’s a hybrid team that we have, with lots of passion and good hearts. Basically, those are the criteria that we look into when we are recruiting new members.

3)During your undergraduate years, you have bagged a series of competitions around the world. Would you like to share your experiences on such competitions like APICTA and NBQSA?

Back in 2007, I won the young computer scientist award which was awarded by British Computer Society and I represented Asia Pacific Society in the same year. Thereafter, I won different entrepreneurship awards including the entrepreneur of the year for digital innovations and so on.

4)Tell us about the experiences on your early projects “Kadapatha”, “Amma” and “Kundalani”.

Kadapatha is a multi-touched table which is basically based on FDI frustrated total internal reflection where we make an array of lots of IRs and do a lot of computer vision engineering in order to understand different touchpoints. We won many awards for that “Kapadatha” research project as well.
Amma is a very special project for me. It is a stress management system for pregnant mothers in their prenatal and postnatal stress stages. We were one of the top 5 finalists in Microsoft Imagine Cup in 2011 for that project. 

5)“Arimac” was implemented in 2008, at a time when ‘gaming’ was a rare sector to invest in. What made you do so?

In the year 2008, we started our venture as a virtual company which later got incorporated in 2011. 
If I am to answer your question, risk is something I always take in my life. In 2008, there were a few number of companies that modulated creativity with technology. We saw a vacuum in the region we live; Asia Pacific. The main challenge we had to face was that, different clients had different perceptions about digitals in that era. Therefore, we had to take different clients from abroad and do different projects for them and then we proved our skills which eventually helped us land our local projects. Actually that’s how we got acquired different clients.

6)Arimac has a very diverse set of operations in it. How do you approach these different functions at the same time?

We always strive to have this boutique environment. We have four key segments that we focus on. One is the web & mobile enterprise where we do lots of websites, enterprise, middleware and mobility solutions for different clients. And we do BFX and computer graphics which involves 3D animations 3D movies etc. We have a separate segment to do game developments and to provide gamification services for different clients along with our game products as well. We also have started a new ring Arimac Cognitive where we do a lot of AI and many other different deep learning technologies. Those are the key areas which we have used to diversify ourselves in our portfolio. 

7)What is your biggest break as “Arimac”? (He’s talking about breakthroughs)

SLPL or Sri Lankan Premier League; we got this project from Bathiya & Santhush. They were handling the SLPL event. They had a requirement for time shifting live stream for 10 minutes. Those days, there was no such software available and the only solution possible was a hardware which was very expensive. So, we coded a software which could time shift a live stream by 10 minutes. That was the breakthrough project for Arimac and because of that project we had a good cash flow to our company and our growth started. 
Another breakthrough is meeting Mr. Anthony Rodrigo, CEO of Dialog Axiata. He understood our passion and talent in this pace and he gave us a lot of opportunities to do different projects for them. That’s how we entered to this market and now we’re catering our solutions for Emirates as well. So we have gained a lot of international clients because of Mr. Rodrigo.

8)“Kanchayuda” became a well-known brand among the youth around the world. Why did you decide to launch it free in Sri Lanka?

First of all, we have had free education and all our members are from Sri Lanka. We also wanted to motivate young game developers and software engineers to do something like this. So after releasing Kanchayuda multiple gaming startups has started which eventually proves that our motive is achieved to a certain extent. Why we have started this is to reduce the brain drain. Lots of young, extremely talented and creative people, mostly the engineers are going abroad. Hence, if we want to have this country to go where we expect it to, we need to have a pool of talented people. Lot of people here are getting a lot of international job opportunities. But, they are choosing to stay here to do something for our own country. We’re cloning ourselves in Sri Lanka and while trying to make a good digital eco-system and a digital economy despite of the government fluctuations. We’re not a government agency and we’re neither related to the government sector which helps us to be very neutral in terms of government activities. But, we’re trying to enhance and help young budding entrepreneurs in terms of showing them that these goals are capable to be achieved in Sri Lanka. That is one of the main motives we had when releasing Kanchayuda for free.

9)Do you think that “Kanchayuda” was able to take you to your desired targets?

No. Kanchayuda is only 1% of the entire pragmatic target or dream that we have. Kanchayuda 2 will be released early next year. That will be published either by a big publisher or it will be published by ourselves as we did before. It’s a juggle that we have. Anyway, we have multiple international publishers onboard to publish the game. In 2019, we will be releasing our first animated movie which will be on par with the international films as well. Modulating all of that will be our desired target we want to achieve.


10)Majority of your projects are based on the values of the Sri Lankan heritage. Don’t you think that it will hinder your global market approach?

Yes, it is hindering my global market, but, it is uplifting my mother tongue and mother country. So I don’t mind hindering my money. I want to take the Sri Lankan brands, Sri Lankan keywords to the world. We know that Ceylon tea is much popular in the world. Just like that, when it comes to the digital or gaming industry, Sri Lanka should be one of the main focal points in the world. That’s the thing we’re trying to achieve. We have done projects like Kundalani, Kadapatha and Amma. Also we have this gaming protocol called imiGames, where we have more than 50 Sri Lankan games. So, it is true that it will hinder us, but it will take our motherland to the next level. So, we don’t mind.

11)“Adventures of Tia” is at the verge of being launched. Give us a little insight on it and share us your plans for it?

“Adventures of Tia” is one of the flagships in Arimac, where we do a lot of innovations. It’s a 3D animated movie which will be released in 2019. But, we haven’t published it yet because every day we’re uplifting the technology stack that we’re using. In the meantime, we’ll be releasing a couple of games for consoles PCs and mobiles. I’m not disclosing much information because that is one of our flagship products. You will see more in the future.

12)It was interesting to learn about your latest applications in Human Computer Interaction, which is a very fresh field to Sri Lanka. What made Arimac invest in such a sector?

At my university times, I was extremely involved in human computer interactions. It shows how the humans interact with different digital devices and interfaces, mapping brain waves to computers, the ways of mapping human gestures to computers and how the touch systems can be mapped to computers. I was an early adapter on gestural computing and I was collaborating with the top universities in the world to do different researches especially in Microsoft Kinect. We were an early adapter in terms of framework and testing. I have more than a decade experience on how EEG works, how mind works and how we can map brain waves into computers, understanding emotions. There are extremely hidden projects under Arimac that we’re working on huge BCI projects where we’re trying to centralize knowledge and memory. It will take at least 5 years but, will be a massive breakthrough in brain computing.

13)What do you have in store for “Arimac” in the future?

We’ll be releasing the first 3D animated movies by 2019. Then we have 12-15 international game titles to be released by 2020. In terms of AI, we will be releasing deep learning engine as a platforms during this year as well. We already have 2 clients for that, but we’ll be releasing it as a product in December. There are a couple of things that is to be released because, we’re working on different complexed websites which we’ll be releasing. Arimac is a service company. In 2020, we have a pragmatic approach to be benchmarked with all those international creative publishers as well. We have a very pragmatic approach towards that. So, we are working passionately and cognitively towards that.

14)What do you owe the success of Arimac to? /How do you see Arimac in future?

Arimac is a family so if I see a success all my members should have a better life. That’s one of the things that we always look into. My family members should always be in the highest level in their lives. In terms of the company, we have a very extremely pragmatic approach to be the leading interactive media content development and publishing company in the world by 2028. Therefore, those are the things I foresee for Arimac to go in the future and also we have the never giving up attitude. Whatever the challenge or obstacle we’ll be having in the future we’ll make sure that we face them with a positive attitude and make mother Lanka the hub of digital innovation. We have an amazing pool of engineers here. We have all resource persons here and all universities, but, the issue I see in Sri Lanka is, the perception. They are going for money in the first place. But, if you chase success and knowledge, then money will come. That’s the perception we need to make. All the Silicon Valley people, what they do is they innovate, they think and they manage and execute. But all those South Asian people are the people who are really developed. So that, we have the talent to be developed, so, we need to make a nation where they think out of the box.
 We’ll never will be a product company because we love services. But, under our services, we have a huge product layer going on. So that’s the sustainable approach or model that we have taken in order to sustain the business. So, mother Lanka should be like that. We have to have an amazing digital economy. We’re receiving lot of dollars from different countries to mother Lanka. So, I think all companies should do that. And then, despite of any fluctuation, if all those intellectual people can come onboard and make one platform where it creams out all those dollars to Sri Lanka, our country will be the most beautiful and the most talented digital innovative hub in Sri Lanka. So that’s the pragmatic approach or whatever the dream that we have towards 2028 will be subset of all these. So, our entire goal is to get our mother Lanka’s name as the most innovative digital country in the world. 

15)What were the downfalls, which you encountered during the past six years of Arimac? How did you overcome those?

I don’t take anything as a downfall. It’s all obstacles or challenges that we’re facing. So we have this ego or the moral that we never give up. Whatever the obstacle or challenge that life gives us we’re always reacting in a positive way and we achieve to the greatest height that we always want to go. So there are no such downfalls, but everyday we’re getting different obstacles and challenges where we love them because those are the things that keep us going towards our goal.

16)What is your advice for an undergraduate who is interested in gaming, AI etc.?

Basically, for an undergraduate they need to know whether they want to start their own business or find a co-founder who can run a business and help him or work for a big corporate. Whatever the path they choose, they need to have a passion. If you like painting, you need to be a painter. Not a singer. There are inborn talents that you are getting. Some qualities can be acquired through experience and knowledge. First, you have to understand which area suits you the best and you need to choose that. The main thing an undergraduate should do is finding the right path to walk through, rather than trying to do everything. I know for a fact that in Sri Lanka they’re doing Fiverr and all those freelancing things, but they exactly hindering their future. They’re working for $5 which will block the path to earn $500 per hour. I know that they have financial issues. I understand. But they should find a way to learn and earn money. What our people do is they work all day, but they don’t learn. That happens to different Asian countries. We really need to eradicate that. They need to find a way to learn and earn money.
